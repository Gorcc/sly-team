He closely resembles the curly hair patterns seen in Haitian men, believing that his ancestry traces back to Haiti. His eyes have a slight almond shape, although there is no connection to the Asian continent. This feature is present in his family genetics as well. He has a small burn on his right arm. When he was 19 years old and working as an apprentice in a garage, while draining the oil from a newly heated car, some oil splashed onto his arm, causing the burn.","2":"The character enjoys skipping stones or throwing rocks on ponds, shorelines, or places with large water pools. Doing this while chatting with friends makes him feel great, and it has become a routine for him to clear his mind. He is a devoted fan of the Los Angeles Lakers and closely follows basketball. His favorite team is the 2000-2002 Lakers. He watches their games regularly on TV or his phone, and occasionally engages in street basketball for the fun of it. He was part of the school basketball team during high school and middle school. Ren loves looking at historical and automotive magazines from his foreign friends, especially those who are Asian. In his childhood, as he couldn't read the language in these magazines, he used to have his friends read them at school. At home, he mostly enjoyed the visual content of these magazines. As he grew older, he continued these habits, occasionally glancing at things he comes across and holding onto his old magazines, experiencing nostalgia for past memories. He enjoys listening to old-school songs and occasionally freestyles as a hobby. Even though he lives on the West Coast, he has a greater affinity for East Coast rappers. His favorite rappers among them are Nas, Mobb Deep, and Mos Def. Ren has always kept this hobby to himself, as he fears being teased or judged by those who know him. As a result, he has never considered doing it in front of people.","3":"Ren is a responsible individual, driven by the desire not to resemble his father, who did not take care of his family at an early age. He fulfills his responsibilities particularly in the pursuit of his goals and tasks. However, if forced to do something he doesn't want to, he may not be as responsible. He is open-minded and respects every idea, yet he is straightforward. Ren cannot stand certain stereotypes, so he is someone who enjoys learning about different people that catch his interest. He is not afraid to speak his mind and can express what he thinks without hesitation, but always in the right context and when it concerns his life. Having a leadership spirit, Ren can motivate himself and others, keeping team spirit and collaboration alive. This stems from his childhood, where he naturally assumed roles like a point guard in basketball or a quarterback in American football. While he may not get along with everyone on a personal level, he can adapt to team chemistry. Ren is a very fair character who cannot tolerate injustice. Despite trying to appear tough on the outside, he is a compassionate person on the inside. This trait has been with him since childhood, and when it comes to money or similar matters, he defends what is right, whether it involves close friends or strangers. He possesses the ability to empathize, even though he may approach people with prejudice initially. After listening to them, he can break down those prejudices. Understanding that everyone's life is difficult in its own way, Ren can empathize with people based on the experiences he gained from his own past. Ren is interested in different cultures and their values, actively seeking opportunities to meet people and engage in knowledge exchange and friendship in this regard. This interest in history has been present in him since childhood, making it one of the few subjects that truly captivates him in school.","4":"Lorenzo Kelly, also known as Ren, was born in 1996 at the Medical Alondra Hospital in Kelly Park, Compton. He has been called Ren since his early childhood, a name derived from his deceased grandfather. Ren grew up in the tough streets and gang-infested neighborhoods of Compton, not having a privileged upbringing but maintaining enthusiasm for the future. Throughout his early years, Ren, under the supervision of his mother, commuted between home and school, preferring to spend time alone rather than socializing with school friends. Ren's early interest in music led him towards the harsh tunes of Ghetto life and the musical culture of the black community. He started freestyling at home alone, and his passion for basketball also shaped during this period. Ren had a few friends during his childhood to adolescence, and his closest companion was Tyrone. The passion for basketball and the challenges of the sport occasionally led Ren to risky situations. Realizing the importance of trustworthy individuals beyond his family, Ren decided to expand his circle to reliable people. The conflicts and difficulties during this time taught him the value of not living alone. In high school, influenced by his surroundings, Ren experimented with habits like smoking, not particularly enjoying it but occasionally doing it to avoid being an outcast. The image he wanted to create around himself became crucial during this period. Ren's mother, seeking to escape the dangers of Compton and create a better life, considered moving to California Sanbernardino. Eventually, she made the decision to move, taking Ren with her. This relocation marked a new chapter in Ren's life, although it came with its challenges, reminiscent of the dangerous neighborhoods of his past. Another area of interest for Ren was vehicles. Listening to Snoop Dogg's 'Riders on the Storm' at a friend's house sparked his fascination with cars. Exploring California's different vehicles, Ren started to dream about his future. Overcoming his laziness, Ren began to pursue becoming a 'Car enthusiast' while continuing his passion for basketball. During his time in Sanbernardino, Ren experienced a brief deviation from his dreams, facing tough times in dangerous areas similar to his past neighborhoods. The song 'Riders on the Storm' took him on a journey of interest in cars, and he began to set goals for his future. Determined to overcome his laziness, Ren started moving towards becoming a 'Car enthusiast' while keeping alive his passion for basketball. As an adult, Ren faced the challenges of transitioning to a more stable work life, reducing his involvement in entertainment and nightlife. Living as a Californian Black, Ren continued his life, having found a way out through a job opportunity and striving towards a more organized lifestyle.","5":"Ren's mother, Keisha Thompson, has an excessively overweight DNA structure, while his father has a slim and tall physique. Ren, having an average body with a slight belly, is the result of this combination. Keisha Thompson, Ren's mother, graduated from high school and got pregnant in her twenties. Her educational life ended with the pregnancy, and she wished for her boyfriend, Jamal Kelly, to take care of her and their son Ren. However, Jamal Kelly, being somewhat independent, did not contribute to the household. Keisha Thompson, once a cheerful person, became more reserved and lived with the regrets of the past due to her early decisions. Before her mother's death, Keisha worked as a hairdresser, a skill she learned from her grandmother. Despite the challenges posed by the dangerous neighborhoods of Compton and Ren's upbringing in the tough streets, Keisha started working at a women's hair salon in Compton, leveraging her knowledge in the field. However, the hazardous nature of Compton and the difficulties of street life, coupled with their solitary existence, made life more challenging for Keisha and Ren. Due to the constant danger of being in a gang-infested neighborhood and witnessing tragedies in the community daily, Keisha decided to leave Kelly Park. Keisha, influenced by her friend's suggestions and connections, considered moving to Sanbernardino. Eventually, she convinced herself, bought bus tickets to Sanbernardino, and settled in a rented apartment shared with her close friend, where she lived with Ren. While Keisha continued her work at the hair salon, Ren took on extra jobs to support their new life. Keisha worked tirelessly to cover Ren's new school expenses, rent, and household bills. Despite the challenges, Ren's biological father, Jamal Kelly, continued to neglect his paternal responsibilities, chasing odd jobs and focusing on his own life without caring about his girlfriend and biological son. Ren was tired of hearing complaints about his biological father Jamal Kelly but could empathize with his mother's frustrations. Keisha, even when Ren was growing up, always spoke negatively about his biological father, warning him never to meet with him and saying that such a meeting would mean she is no longer his mother. As Ren's father abandoned them, Ren decided to overcome his laziness during high school and began working for himself and his mother. In adulthood, Keisha took on light jobs while Ren used his earnings to support his mother financially. Ren, weary of the constant negativity surrounding his biological father, adopted his mother's last name unofficially during childhood and made it official when he became an adult.","6":"Due to the insufficient attention from both parents, Ren can say that he did not receive any parental education before preschool. The abandonment of Ren's father and his mother working to support the household marked the beginning of Ren doing things on his own and learning to be self-reliant. Ren's school life started in elementary school, as preschool education was not possible due to their family's situation. Ren, always being around while his mother worked, started attending Kelly Elementary School in Compton when he reached elementary school age. However, living in the dangerous state of Compton, with gang wars and the streets dominated by gangs, troubled Keisha, Ren's mother. When she learned of opportunities to continue her job in California Sanbernardino, she decided to move there with Ren to keep him away from this life. Consequently, Ren transferred to a different school in the middle of elementary school. The ongoing changes did not provide a smooth adaptation for a child growing up alone and essentially living alone. Throughout elementary school, Ren, who had trouble getting along and communicating with others, became an independent individual with few friends. His mother continued to work at the hair salon she found through her friend's connections while taking on a second job and pursuing extra work. This was due to Ren trying to cover new school expenses while working part-time. After navigating through elementary school in this way, Ren started attending Curtis Middle School in California Sanbernardino. Unlike before, Ren became a bit more social during middle school, engaging mostly in sports, especially playing basketball and being part of the basketball team. Ren, a huge Lakers fan, aspired to be a versatile point guard like Magic Johnson and did his best on the school team. As Ren gained recognition from people for his efforts, he enjoyed the feeling it brought and became more ambitious for his goals. Ren had a good relationship with his friend Tyrone, who treated him like a little brother. Despite Ren being mostly alone and growing up without a father, he valued having people more than living alone. His friend Rian, of mixed Japanese and American descent, introduced Ren to cars and Japanese culture. Ren became fascinated with the existence of different worlds and technologies, developing an interest in historical things. Ren's overall academic average was consistently moderate, with history and sports classes being his favorites. After completing middle school, Ren entered San Gorgonio High School. Unfortunately, he couldn't attend the same high school as Rian due to economic reasons. However, Tyrone's situation was similar to Ren's, so both started attending San Gorgonio High School together. Ren maintained communication with Rian, occasionally visiting his house, immersing himself in car magazines, looking at pictures, listening to music, and getting lost in his imagination. One day, while hanging out at Rian's house, a new hit song started playing on the radio, Snoop Dogg's 'Riders on the Storm.' Ren became a fan of every lyric, repeatedly rewinding and listening to Jim Morrison's choruses, fueling his growing interest in cars. Ren, influenced by this, and with Rian, would enter the garage at Rian's house, inspect the details of the parked car, and try to learn things like gears and gas. Over time, he attempted to drive his mother's friend's car around the neighborhood, gradually learning how to drive. During high school, Ren's grades deteriorated, and he barely passed some classes. High school was extended by a year due to him having to repeat the final year. Ren's passion for basketball was replaced by a temporary depressive state caused by boredom, as he didn't have anything that interested him. Eventually, Ren worked odd jobs for a while, saved money, and got his driver's license. A friend of his mother's boyfriend kindly gave him a few lessons. Ren obtained his driver's license at the age of 17, rekindling some of his old excitement and making him happy. Ren finished high school with a low average and worked for a while to gather money for his license. Although Rian was unable to attend the same high school, Ren and Tyrone started San Gorgonio High School together. Ren remained connected with Rian, occasionally visiting his house and continuing their friendship. Despite his struggles in school, Ren's mother constantly complained about his biological father, Jamal Kelly. However, Ren was aware that Jamal contributed little more than economic support. Ren chose to ignore the contradictions and focused on working hard for himself and his mother.","7":"Ren's love life has been a rather uncertain and enlightening journey. His love story actually began in high school. Being a child who had trouble communicating in middle school, he had never thought about such matters and had not experienced anything in that regard. However, in high school, playing on the school's basketball team gave him both an athlete identity and attractive selfconfidence. During this time, he met a girl named Iggy Brown, who was the popular girl in the class. Initially, Iggy's interest in Ren stemmed from his athletic achievements. However, Ren was looking for a relationship beyond just that. Not being sure if what he felt was love, the thought that it could be his first love led Ren through an emotional maturation process. While Iggy's initial interest was superficial, the relationship deepened as she discovered Ren's inner world. However, when Iggy's high school ended, and she had to go to a different city for university, and due to Ren repeating a year in high school, their relationship came to an end. During the years of repeating high school, Ren turned into someone who had neither academic achievements nor interest in social activities. Not being able to play basketball, his girlfriend having a more successful school career, and their subsequent breakup introduced him to a feeling he had never experienced before: heartbreak. Ren felt as if he had hit rock bottom for the first time in his life. This emotional state made him somewhat aggressive, even towards his friend Tyrone, treating him like a little brother. One day, Ren, in a fit of rage, physically struck Tyrone. Tyrone, who dropped to the ground, not even considering the pain of the blow to his face, began searching for a small photo that fell from his pocket. Seeing Tyrone picking up the photo, Ren realized that the person in the picture was Tyrone's deceased mother. Witnessing how he hurt someone he considered a little brother, Ren was overwhelmed with genuine disappointment and regret. This experience felt different from the disappointments of lost basketball games. Tyrone quickly left the scene, and Ren, kneeling on the ground, began contemplating his actions and acknowledging how foolish he had been. After a long period of reflection, Ren understood that life goes on regardless of whatever happens, and his troubles were not the only ones in the world. He vowed not to hurt his loved ones and matured emotionally for the first time in his life. Meanwhile, a girl named Maya, whom he met in a student organization, had been silently observing events from a distance. After some time, Maya came over and sat next to Ren. When Ren raised his head, feeling not in the mood to talk at the moment, Maya simply told him, 'Don't turn into someone you don't want to be. There's no solution to what's already happened, so never hurt your loved ones,' and walked away. Hearing these words, Ren made his first analysis of what had happened and promised himself not to do such a thing again. That day marked the beginning of Ren's maturity. Despite feeling embarrassed, Ren later thanked Maya for her words and expressed his desire to be friends. Maya accepted this, and their friendship began. Maya, with her father's troubled relationship, became Ren's confidante, and he provided her with advice based on his experience with his absent father. In his later years, Ren's focus on his professional life, responsibilities, and pressures in the business world led him to devote less time to his love life. However, during a car inspection trip to Sanbernardino, he unexpectedly met Loli. Loli entered Ren's life not only as a romantic partner but also as a supportive friend. The strong bond between them greatly helped Ren cope with work stress. Ren has learned a lot from the relationships in this period of his life. Each relationship brought different perspectives, values, and experiences to him. The ups and downs in his love life strengthened him and developed his emotional intelligence. Currently, Ren is determined to maintain a healthier and more conscious love life in the remainder of his life, using these experiences in the relationships he will encounter.","8":"After high school, Ren chose not to go to college and spent some time doing odd jobs, obtaining his driver's license on a whim. However, he soon found himself in a monotonous routine again due to the lack of a clear purpose in his life. Fueled by his interest in cars, he decided to try working in a Sanbernardino workshop. Despite initial hesitation and struggles, Ren took the plunge and started working there. As an apprentice in a predominantly African-American community's industry, Ren grew weary of constantly dealing with American-made cars, leading him to become a lackadaisical apprentice, not taking his job seriously and causing issues. During this period, an accident at work resulted in hot oil spilling on Ren's hand, leaving him with a small burn on his left arm. Ren eventually lost his job due to his own irritable behavior. In the aftermath, he visited his friend Rian one summer day. While Rian and Ren engaged in their usual banter, Ren suddenly noticed a car from Rian's father's toy car collection. The car, a 'R31 Skyline (1985),' piqued Ren's interest, and as Rian explained more about Japanese cars, they found themselves in a deep and prolonged conversation. Over time, Ren grew closer to Rian and was introduced to his close friend Tyrone. Together, they formed a group and began hanging out, gradually gaining more knowledge about cars. Rian constantly tried to reach out to Ren, attempting to convince him to consider a job offer related to his father's business. Despite Ren's skepticism, he eventually accepted Rian's offer to work as an apprentice once again in his father's workshop. Ren, initially lazy and reluctant, found himself rescued from his misguided decisions when Rian requested him to work with a mechanic rather than doing menial jobs. During his apprenticeship, Ren performed various odd jobs and had limited opportunities for observation. Ren, motivated by the experiences, became a more conscious individual and started dreaming of owning a Japanese Domestic Market (JDM) car. He began attending car meetings in California Sanbernardino and, despite still being an apprentice, actively participated in promoting the workshop's services at these events. Ren's growing interest in drift racing became evident as he observed professional drifters during street shows organized by car enthusiasts. Ren's newfound consciousness about financial matters and his dream of owning a specific JDM car led him to become more financially responsible. While most of California Sanbernardino was inclined towards drag racing, Ren found a niche in his interest in drift racing. He gradually became more involved, occasionally attempting to drift using the workshop's work car, often leaving visible marks. Ren's passion for drift racing grew, and he reached out to owners of impressive cars at car meetings, gaining basic knowledge about them. One morning, Ren and Rian stumbled upon an ad for a Toyota Chaser JZX 100 with minor damage and a need for an exterior overhaul. Despite their desire to buy the car, they lacked the necessary funds, and it was quickly purchased by someone else. This event left a lasting impression on them. Motivated by missed opportunities, Ren became a more thoughtful person, realizing the importance of not letting such chances slip away. Ren's growing interest in drift racing and his involvement in car meetings with Rian and Tyrone pushed him to become a more stable and hopeful individual. He and his friends contemplated forming their own group or team for street shows. Despite being an amateur, Ren's passion for the job and his commitment to working with people he trusted made him happier and more dedicated to his work. Despite being at the beginning of his learning journey, Ren continued to thrive in his newfound career","9":"Ren, born into an African-American family in the United States, resides in a region where the family structure is not as stable as in European countries. The cultural diversity in Compton, California, where Ren was born, has significantly shaped his character, especially influenced by the AfricanAmerican community's impact on music and the arts. In terms of human interactions, Compton is known for its rich African-American culture. People in this community are warm and approach each other with a sense of sincerity. Those who are close to their families have strong bonds, and community solidarity is highly valued due to the prevalent racism and discrimination in America. Ren's family, surrounded by the diverse cultural environment of Compton, embraces a lifestyle shaped by various values, with respect for different beliefs and traditions. Compton is not solely inhabited by African-Americans; it shares borders with Mexican communities, and people from various other countries come to America, further enriching its cultural fabric. Ren, growing up in this melting pot of cultures, has been exposed to unique musical and artistic influences. Ren's family, particularly his mother, actively participates in cultural events like neighborhood barbecues and traditional festivals. These events, along with music parties, dance activities, and clubs established by African-American societies, have formed a strong bond between Ren and the cultural roots of the community. Ren, at times, engages in these social activities, finding them enjoyable as long as he does not overindulge. The cultural influence on Ren's life is also reflected in sports, with basketball being a favorite among the community. Ren's early involvement in basketball, driven by his family's connection to the African-American culture, shaped his affinity for the sport. Overall, Ren's cultural background in Compton has played a crucial role in shaping his identity, values, and the way he perceives the world around him. The challenges and strengths of his community have left a lasting impact on Ren's character.","10":"Ren found himself working at a mechanic shop in California, San Bernardino, where the workload prevented him from learning much, and he struggled to receive proper compensation. Ren, who was content with his routine yet faced economic challenges, was going through a tough period. While things were going well at Rian's father's mechanic shop, the issue arose with payments for the main mechanics and subsequently the apprentices, leaving Ren and a few others under the title of workers unpaid or receiving incomplete payments. Despite Ren being in proximity to Rian, Rian claimed he couldn't do anything about the situation. As Ren contemplated his situation, he couldn't help but notice news about the conditions in Los Santos for an extended period. In Ren's mind, the plan to leave and use the experience gained here for a fresh start elsewhere grew. He entertained ideas of going to Europe, Ohio, or Los Santos. A Danish friend he knew from basketball suggested Europe, emphasizing the possibility of finding work in a completely different field and potentially establishing a better life there. Ohio, on the other hand, was suggested by his mother's childhood friend, hinting at opportunities in the agricultural sector, though uncertain. The thought of going to Los Santos began when Rian's father sent him to a fair held there. Ren contemplated the idea of starting a new job or finding employment there. Having followed the difficult times on television, Ren heard about the renewal and restructuring process. Rian, after attending new job fairs, informed Ren about the possibility of establishing a new business or finding a job there. Ren, trying to navigate through the difficult decision-making process, felt frustrated by the indecision. Rian, having returned from Los Santos, joined Ren and Tyrone one evening by the pond. As they chatted and had a beer, Ren, skimming pebbles on the water, listened to Rian's experiences and what he had witnessed. Rian's stories excited Ren and Tyrone, and together, they made the decision to go to Los Santos. Purchasing tickets for city orientation, Ren, along with Tyrone and Rian, decided to embark on this new adventure. Ren, later that evening, discussed the situation with his mother, who assured him that she could manage on her own. With his mother's approval, Ren felt reassured. On his last day at work, Ren woke up, prepared with a suitcase his mother had packed, met Tyrone and Rian at the bus departure location, and boarded the bus for Los Santos.","11":"Lorenzo 'Ren' Kelly's post-work nightlife and San Bernardino night car scene: When you think of California's San Bernardino, after 11 pm, what comes to mind are the unauthorized car events held in vast, empty factory areas, arranged through phones or group locations. Ren, during his working hours, participated in officially authorized events several times. However, he also attended a few of these unauthorized gatherings that were not explicitly illegal but rather on the edge of legality, based on the information he heard slipped from people's mouths during work or overheard as a casual observer. After a while, a customer who was passionate about his car shared his number with Ren and provided him with the location details for these unauthorized meetings. In these gatherings, certain drivers in Ren's surroundings were adept at drifting. Rian and Ren, however, had no knowledge in this regard. With a scrap car borrowed from Rian's father, they simply parked and strolled around. Although Ren didn't have his car, he could treat the borrowed car with goodwill as it belonged to his friend. The idea of forming their own group, much like other drag racers and drifter teams in the city, was a constant thought, and they planned to realize it someday. Ren always admired Rian. Rian's stories about Japanese culture and his descriptions of those distant lands fascinated Ren, prompting him to occasionally delve into books about East Asian cultures. Ren's friend Tyrone, currently unemployed, joined them for an upcoming car event, participating once in these unauthorized gatherings. Another friend of Rian, who attended an event to spend some time, boasted about the superiority of the cars in his hometown, emphasizing his father's Silvia. This caught Ren's interest, but he didn't take the person seriously due to his arrogant attitude. Eventually, Ren created a WhatsApp and Instagram group, adding these individuals. They shared humorous posts and mutual interests, keeping each other updated on event developments. Despite Ren's work commitments, they planned meetups and shared their excitement in the group, although they couldn't dedicate much time to it due to work.","12":"As he arrives in Los Santos, Ren is known for his initially pessimistic outlook, often considering negative scenarios before transitioning to a more optimistic perspective. He harbors significant concerns about his career but envisions a job he can passionately undertake, expecting respect from his surroundings and aiming to engage in social activities related to his work. Ren is a sociable individual who strives to make people appreciate what he does. His goals include: Establishing a healthy position in the automotive sector and pursuing a job he genuinely enjoys. Carefully selecting people to bring into his life, with a focus on finding a life partner and planning for the future. As someone who frequently uses the vehicles and devices of those around him, Ren dreams of owning his own car and aims to stand on his own feet. Seeking to build quality relationships in his social world, Ren aims to integrate his success in work with his personal relationships. Although he has taken freestyle and rap as hobbies, Ren plans to gather the courage to pursue these interests publicly. Career-related concerns serve as a significant motivational source for Ren. However, he intends to balance these concerns with the desire to engage in a job he loves. Ren aspires to view his work not just as a duty but also as a source of passion and joy. Additionally, he aims to replace the desire for negative thoughts with an optimistic perspective as he embarks on his new life, focusing on selfimprovement.","fear":"Ren developed a fear of needles (trypanophobia) during adolescence, stemming from receiving an excessive number of vaccinations due to having had chickenpox and the need for immunization against Hepatitis A and B diseases at school. Whenever there was a situation involving a doctor's check-up during school times, Ren would escape from school, avoiding the day altogether. In addition to this, like any individual, Ren has anxieties about the future. Deep down, he never wants to be alone. This mindset is directly connected to the distance he has with his father. He doesn't want any other absence in his life.","negative":"Ren is an impatient character. While he doesn't give up easily on his goals, he expects results quickly. Throughout his life, having not had many things, he always wants to obtain what he can as quickly as possible. He is not overly optimistic, often leaning towards negative thinking (contemplating worst-case scenarios). He plans and acts based on this perspective, and his generally inability to think positively is a negative aspect of his personality. The reason for this is that Ren is an advocate of positive discrimination for Black individuals, recognizing it as their right due to the historical racism they have faced. For example, he supports the idea of universities, historically known for racism, opening quotas specifically for Black students. While the global consensus is that discrimination is never right or wrong, Ren defends this based on the history of racism against Black people. Ren is a bit obsessive. Repeated thoughts can make him obsessive. For example, if he has a falling out with his friends, he may start to believe that everyone has taken sides against him to an extent of overthinking. Although social, Ren is not overly social, and when there is a rift with his close ones, he has developed such obsessions, but they have never turned out as serious as he thought. To a somewhat reasonable extent, Ren has had moments of vindictiveness. He doesn't forget what has been done to him in life, and if given the chance to retaliate (verbally or otherwise), he won't hesitate to speak up. Living a bit too attached to his past, Ren doesn't want to repeat things he thinks he couldn't do in the past and often dwells on these moments, not wanting to repeat them in the future.","illegal":"Ren's birthplace, Compton, and later his youth in San Bernardino, have struggled and been associated with criminal activities over time. The connection with illegal activities is directly linked to the strong sense of solidarity in Ren's neighborhood. Ren has sometimes observed that illegal activities are carried out for protection and mutual support. The challenges he witnessed in life, where the strong often oppress the weak, made Ren understand the need for security and protection. Despite the difficulties of being intertwined with illegal culture, Ren, at one point, saw it as an outlet and tried to become involved. However, with the efforts of his mother and close friends, and due to tragic events he experienced, Ren strayed from this path and focused on building his own future despite the negativity around him."},"dave":{"1":"Dave has brown eyebrows and eyes, black skin, and black hair color. He inherited his brown eyes and eyebrows from his mother Nichelle and his skin color and hair color from his father Ramiro. Since his father Ramiro's genes are more dominant than his mother Nichelle's, his facial structure resembles his father. She has a short, black hairstyle and a medium beard and mustache. There are no features on his body and face. Since the hair on his chest and arms is hormonally sparse, it is difficult to see from a distance. It has a tulip-shaped, short nail structure. The shape of his hair, beard, and mustache, as well as the accessories and clothes he wears, change according to Dave's mood.","2":"I like taking pictures. People used to get angry when they saw me taking pictures of their vehicles and would come up to me and ask why I was taking pictures of them. People's angry behavior used to scare me a lot, and I didn't know what to do. When I told them that I was interested in their vehicles and that's why I was recording their photos, they liked it. The compliments I receive from people and immortalizing that moment makes me happy. I like cycling. When I used to go on nature trips, I used to take my bicycle with me. My father gave me his father's bicycle as a gift. I didn't like my grandfather's mountain bike because it was heavy and big. I sold the mountain bike and bought myself a new Bmx bicycle. The Bmx bicycle was lighter and more practical, so I could take it everywhere. The most fun I have on the bicycle is to spread my legs and speed down the slope while going downhill, and to let go of both hands and ride while walking around the neighborhood. I love to eat. Thanks to my mother, my interest in food grew. Most of the time I didn't have time to have breakfast because I left home early. Mixed sandwiches were more than enough to fill me up and they were easy to prepare. I still don't understand how people can eat hot dog sandwiches. I like going to the movies. When I was young, my father used to take me to the movies when we spent time together. In the first Coach Carter movie I went to with my father, I was touched when Timo Cruz came crying to Coach Carter's house with his t-shirt covered in blood. I like cars. In the past, different vehicles would come to the mechanic shop where I used to apprentice and have problems. The decorations, add-ons, and appearances of the different vehicles increased my curiosity about cars. Especially with open-top vehicles, I felt like a bird when I raised my arms in the air and the wind blew in my face. I like taking care of cats. When I was walking around outside, I saw a black cat watching cats eating milk and bread left in a plastic container by the wall. Seeing me approaching him, the cat took a few steps back and started meowing. I took something out of my bag and put it in front of him to eat. He slowly approached and started to eat the snacks I gave him. After he finished, he approached my leg and rubbed against me. The fact that the other cats couldn't go near her and that she rubbed against my leg affected me deeply emotionally. The emotion I experienced that day strengthened my bond with cats.","3":"I'm emotional. My father used to say that crying makes you feel better. When I was complimented by people and felt happy, when I was used by my fake schoolmates and felt small, when I was oppressed and ridiculed by people, I couldn't control the tears flowing out of my eyes because I was overwhelmed by the chaos of emotions inside me. I couldn't describe the sensation in my body. When I cried, I felt powerless. No matter how powerless crying made me feel, I felt peaceful and really relaxed afterwards. I am optimistic. I realized that the problems I had verbally with people and the problems that people had, I was always trying to approach them from my point of view, so I found myself in constant arguments. Instead of looking for problems in other people, I thought about how I could bring a solution to this problem myself, and I thought that always approaching people's opinions from the bottom could solve this problem. When I realized that when I approached all the situations I experienced optimistically, my problems with people actually decreased, I learned that being optimistic both reduced my problems with people and made me happy. I am skeptical. I discovered that this trait of mine became stronger after I was threatened by gang members at the mechanic's shop where I worked as an apprentice in the South Los Santos area. I realized that before taking a job, even if it is your passion, you should investigate very well whether the work environment of that job is suitable for you and the work to be done. I am a helper. When I was young, my parents told me that helping others was a respectful behavior. They told me that the more I helped, the more likely it was that when I faced difficult situations in the future, I would find people like me. When I helped people in the South Los Santos area who were hungry and could not afford to buy food, my soul was filled with happiness. I am an empath. When we were telling each other our problems and stories during the association time, when I listened to the stories of people with different opinions, I would put myself in their shoes. I would think about the difficulties they were going through, the emotions they were feeling and how to approach them. In order to express that I understood the emotions they were trying to overcome, I would mention that there was a way to overcome them. Thanks to empathy, I was able to create a harmonious bond with people.","9":"Dave's parents were born in the United States and raised Dave in an American culture. Dave's interest in the food of his country, such as his love of barbecue, comes from his mother's preparation of American cuisine. Dave calls the culture of respect the foundation of who he is. The culture of respect was passed on to Ramiro by grandfather Dave, who grew up in America, and to Dave by Ramiro. He recognizes that the best way to understand people is to respect their opinions. Dave is a person who likes to recycle and does not like to waste. He is uncomfortable with the situation of people in his own country, as the problems of excessive consumption by people who create a negative problem in the United States lead to a negative impact on human life. Because American citizens have a high degree of positive acceptance of the use of guns and have made it a culture in America, Dave has experienced a disconnect with the people in his country who defend this situation because of the news of deaths he saw when he was young. He is not completely against armament, but he is against this culture being so widespread and flexible.","12":"When my grandfather was alive, they used to organize trips to different countries when the company business was progressing. After the trips, they rented a small place in California to keep their business organized and comfortable. They continued their business there until my father Ramiro inherited the company. My father, Ramiro, decided that it would be appropriate to move to Los Santos because of the high gang population in the state of the company's region in California and the renewal of infrastructure and the reduction of crises in the city of Los Santos as an advantage. As a family, we moved to Los Santos at a young age because of my father's work. The city had many areas we could explore, such as hiking parks, bicycle areas, beaches. Discovering such areas, visiting new places that I had not seen before, and being able to realize my hobbies increased my love for the city. The fact that certain neighborhoods in the city are desolate and creepy, and that there are problems such as theft and extortion, the thought that a bad event could happen to me at any moment, causes my anxiety to increase according to the desolation of the streets I pass.","fear":"I'm afraid of being let down. I'm afraid that if I trust people and they disregard the value I give them and treat me as if I don't exist, it will make me relive the feelings of my old years. In high school, I used to think that the people I made friends with said they were friends to make me do their errands. The truth of this thought would continue to increase day by day with their behavior towards me, pretending I didn't exist, not caring about what I said. I am afraid of reptile animals. When I used to go on nature walks, I used to see worms around the flowers. I wanted to pick one up and examine it. When I put the worm in my hand, it started to crawl quickly and the feeling it gave me made my face crinkle. Since that day, wherever I see a reptile animal, an uncomfortable feeling arises in me. I am afraid of natural disasters. The videos of natural disasters I saw on the internet gave me new fears. Especially objects flying in the air with the effect of strong winds in intense stormy weather frighten me. Once, when I was leaving the mall with my mother, I was really creeped out when the grocery carts in the parking lot of the mall hit the walls due to the wind. I am afraid of being ostracized. When I was little, it made me question why different children had more than one friend and why I was not like them. When I went to the kids playing soccer: 'Why don't you include me among you?' and they would say something like: 'Because you are black'. Although it was difficult to overcome this trauma from my childhood, I am happy that I was able to move forward. When I am in environments with new people I don't know, my fear of exclusion often comes back to me. I am afraid of loneliness. I always wanted to have a friend I could talk to about my problems, call when I was lonely and spend time together. Russell lived next door to us. Since the day we met, he had been a big brother and a friend to me. He would guide me and give me ideas when I was stuck. Losing Russell would affect me deeply emotionally and turn me into a hopeless person. I am very afraid of losing people with whom I have strong friendships","negative":"I am in a hurry. When I want something to be done quickly, I always mess it up. When I want to do something, the concept of time makes me feel pressure and puts me under stress. I am fragile. Negative behaviors done to me by people cause me to have a resentful mood. Being aware of this trait and not being able to fix it really upsets me. I am shy. I have thoughts about stepping into new jobs. The thought of whether I will get a comment from the outside when I do that job pushes me back in some matters. I am excited. Approaching situations with excitement and positivity, overestimating them, and then regretting and despairing at the end, complicates my emotions. I am touchy. A comment made about me immerses me in thoughts. It makes me think about it constantly. This makes it difficult for me to think about my daily life and the decisions I have to make."},"tyrone":{"1":"My character's parents do not have a genetic predisposition to gain weight. Despite experiencing childhood obesity due to social withdrawal and a fast-food diet, Tyrone currently weighs 83 kilograms and has a normal physique, given his height of 1.88 meters. Tyrone is a light-skinned African American with brown eyes and dark brown hair. His hair is often curly, and he prefers styles like braids to manage its natural volume. Occasionally, he opts for afro styles. Due to his weight loss after childhood obesity, Tyrone has stretch marks on his arms, back, and various parts of his body. At the age of 16, during an incident where he found himself crawling on the ground, he injured his knees, leaving linear scar marks on both kneecaps.","2":"Tyrone's favorite activity is following Formula 1 races. When he was a child, his father used to watch Formula races on TV constantly. Although Tyrone didn't understand what was happening, he would always gaze at the television. As he grew older and reached an age to comprehend sports, he gradually began to understand the logic of the sport and developed a keen interest in it. He would regularly check the newspapers for team and driver standings. However, due to the lesser popularity of F1 in America compared to Europe, he couldn't share his excitement with friends. At the age of 10, when he discovered his father's records, he developed a tremendous fascination for Hip-Hop and Gangster Rap. He would listen to different songs for hours without stopping. One day, the thought occurred to him that he could do it too. He started listening to songs with a notebook and pen in hand, writing down the lyrics of several tracks. One of the first songs he memorized was 'Straight Outta Compton' since he was born in Compton. Despite having a poor voice, he began recording and memorizing numerous songs. However, he never mustered the courage to sing in front of others. Due to basketball training received at a young age in school, Tyrone developed an incredible interest in basketball. He loved playing basketball not only in school but also with his friends in the neighborhood. However, he never considered himself sufficient. Whenever he played with friends, he would get sweaty and exhausted due to his weight. After losing weight, he became comfortable playing with friends. As he often visited his father, who worked at an auto repair shop, Tyrone's interest in cars developed at an early age. He started reading magazines featuring modified cars that came to the repair shop once or twice a month. Over time, learning technical information from his father and friends, he began to understand what was written in the magazines. He tried to remember every part and modification of cars his father and friends worked on. Seeing these parts in magazines brought him extra joy. He has loved reading these magazines since childhood. Having lost his parents at a very young age, Tyrone moved in with his only living relative, his aunt Betty. As a result, he missed his friendships and family there immensely. When he first moved, he was very lonely and too young. He didn't even have a playmate. Throughout his life, he never wanted to experience this loneliness again. His biggest fear is loneliness due to this reason. When he was young, he suffered from obesity due to inactivity and a fast-food diet, missing out on many things he loved. Additionally, he was subjected to severe bullying by other children. He remembered this incident throughout his life and always paid attention to his diet. He is scared of regaining his health and becoming obese again. A traumatic incident in his childhood left Tyrone with a lasting impact. One day, while returning home from one of his walks to lose weight, a cat jumped out of the trash and splashed on him. In the panic, Tyrone fell, breaking his arm. Due to this trauma, Tyrone developed a fear of cats. During weekends in his childhood, he used to go to the beach with his parents. He enjoyed swimming in the sea, especially in the California heat during summer. These adventures in Long Beach were very soothing for him, and he had the opportunity to play on the beach with his father. However, one day, when Tyrone was swimming and wanted to go deeper, he realized he couldn't see the bottom. He had just learned to swim and had taken off his armbands. His parents were not in the water at that moment. They were sunbathing on the shore and hadn't noticed Tyrone. After venturing a bit deeper, he began looking down into the water. It was too deep, and he got scared. Panicking, he started thrashing around and began swallowing water. His father heard Tyrone's voice and saved him. Tyrone developed trauma from the incident. Even today, he can't swim in deep waters and, if forced to swim, never looks down.","3":"Due to his upbringing, Tyrone is respectful towards elders, instilled with values of politeness by his family. While his father worked at the auto repair shop, Tyrone assisted him in various tasks, always eager to lend a hand. Similarly, after losing his parents, he helped his elderly aunt with household chores without hesitation. He possesses an outgoing and hardworking personality. After losing his parents at a young age, Tyrone tried different jobs to avoid burdening his aunt. He never complained about the circumstances, always opting for whatever job paid more. Being a good friend is one of his strengths. Throughout significant friendships with Ren, Doug, and Rian, Tyrone provided support in every aspect, being there for them. Likewise, the way his friends treated Tyrone contributed to the development of this aspect of his personality. Despite coming from a humble background, Tyrone is generous and open-handed, a result of his well-rounded upbringing. Even when he had no money, he left some for his aunt as a gesture of gratitude. He shared everything possible with his friends. Winning Tyrone over only requires good conversation. He even gave a joint, which was expensive for him, as a gift to Russell, someone he had recently met. He has always been passionate and enthusiastic, from a new job to meeting a new person. This holds true for every moment of his life. When starting a new job, he puts in his best effort with enthusiasm. This passion extends to his friendships, viewing friends as more than just companions, almost like siblings, and he is willing to do anything for them. His perspective on tragic events has changed after experiencing various incidents. As a result, he developed a chronically sarcastic personality. While he may speak sarcastically with friends, he makes an effort not to do so with new acquaintances. It's challenging for him to restrain himself, but he manages. This trait reflects his inability to take tragic events seriously. Although he enjoys making fun of others, being teased himself irritates him. Influenced by listening to NWA in his youth, Tyrone harbors hatred towards racism against black individuals. Having personally experienced racism, he is more sensitive than usual when it comes to racial issues. Having experimented with drug production before, Tyrone is not hesitant about using drugs. With a tendency to become addicted to things he loves, Tyrone is susceptible to drug addiction. Therefore, he strives to keep himself away from drugs as much as possible. His inclination towards becoming involved in activities that could turn him into a dependent individual, similar to the drug example, is evident. Despite approaching everything with great passion and enthusiasm, Tyrone easily gets bored and is impatient. He tends to act impatiently when attempting to do something, wanting it to happen immediately. However, when it does, he often finds himself in an undesired situation. When he first wanted to move to Los Santos, he immediately did so and later found himself in an unwanted involvement in the drug trade. Having been alone and excluded throughout his life, the impact of his obesity was significant in his early years. Being someone who rarely lets people into his life, dislikes doing so, and cannot form close relationships with more than 4-5 people, Tyrone is emotionally reserved. He never opens up about his feelings, keeping them to himself. In terms of emotional expression, he is introverted.","4":"Tyrone's life began with an abundance of love from his mother and father, who were overindulgent from the moment he was born. However, the excessive attention from his parents made Tyrone somewhat weary of love. Born overweight, Tyrone lost weight as he started walking. Yet, at the age of 7, he abandoned his slender form when friends introduced him to fast food and snacks. Constantly indulging in eating, he refrained from going out, only stepping outside to attend school. Lacking any physical activity besides basketball practices at school, he started gaining more weight each day. Unable to exercise as he wished, Tyrone faced pain and sleepless nights due to exhaustion, even losing the ability to enjoy basketball, his once favorite activity. Feeling it was time for a change, he decided to embark on a weight loss journey. Shedding the extra pounds required significant effort. The process, involving abstaining from food and long walks, was exhausting for him. One day, returning from one of his long walks, a stray cat jumped on him from a trash bin. Startled, he slipped and fell, breaking his arm. As the cat leaped away, it hissed at him. The incident frightened and demoralized Tyrone, especially since the broken arm meant a month without walking, delaying his weight loss efforts. After recovery, his father, wanting to cheer him up, started calling him to his workplace, approximately 5 kilometers away. Tyrone eagerly anticipated this route, as he loved seeing cars and reading car magazines with his father. Even though he didn't understand much, his father and his friends shared their knowledge about cars with him. He never questioned his father's advice, assisting him in various tasks. By doing daily exercises and eating less, Tyrone eventually achieved a normal weight for a child. However, rapid weight loss left him with stretch marks and sagging skin. He enjoyed swimming in the sea, finding solace in the water. During childhood, they used to go to the beach as a family. Swimming in the sea brought him great happiness, especially in the hot weather, providing a sense of freedom. However, after a traumatic incident when he was learning to swim, where he nearly drowned, he avoided looking down in deep waters, even when swimming. At the age of 10, while exploring the basement of his home, Tyrone found some music records with 'N.W.A' written on them. Although he couldn't understand the messages conveyed in the songs due to his young age, he enjoyed listening to rap music for its pleasing sound. Curious about N.W.A, he asked his father, who explained how the group was formed and introduced him to members like EazyE, Ice Cube, and MC Ren. Discovering more records in the back room, Tyrone's interest in rap music grew, and he slowly adapted to listening to music on records. The records belonged to artists like Eazy-E, Ice Cube, and MC Ren. These musicians conveyed messages of hatred towards blacks in their music, igniting a fire within Tyrone. After N.W.A's music, he explored and enjoyed solo albums. Despite his poor singing ability, he recorded and memorized numerous songs. Although he never mustered the courage to perform in front of others, he spent hours singing alone, analyzing his own style. At the age of 11, Tyrone began to grasp the messages in the songs he listened to, connecting with the struggles of being black portrayed in the lyrics. Despite his family's disapproval, he started adopting a street lifestyle, immersing himself in the ghetto. Although he occasionally played basketball with friends in parks, he witnessed freestyle rap battles by street performers, which fascinated him. However, despite his enthusiasm for rap music and singing alone, he realized he lacked the talent to become a rapper. As he turned 13, Tyrone's family faced a tragic incident when unknown individuals, associated with gang activities, shot and killed his parents during a street confrontation. Shocked and orphaned, Tyrone moved in with his aunt, Betty, who lived in San Bernardino. Initially, he felt a sense of loneliness, obediently following his aunt's instructions and trying to expand his social circle. Betty informed him that Ren, a family friend's son, also lived in the area. Although acquainted, they weren't close. Ren, being older and more mature, had more experience with street life, shielding Tyrone from certain aspects of it. Ren worked as a mechanic, and due to Tyrone's dislike for school, he asked Ren to arrange a job for him. However, Tyrone preferred technical work over physical labor. Intelligent and curious, he could quickly grasp technical concepts. Ren convinced his boss to hire Tyrone, and he began working at the mechanic shop. Despite the initial challenges, Tyrone worked diligently, learning the trade under Ren's guidance. Over time, Ren and Tyrone's relationship improved, and Tyrone met Rian, Ren's friend from school. Rian, like Ren, had a passion for cars but focused more on technical aspects. Rian shared his knowledge with Tyrone, and the three formed a bond, with Ren and Rian acting as mentors. As the years passed, Tyrone matured. Ren introduced him to the workings of the streets, and they delved into slang and drug distribution together. However, when Tyrone attempted to learn drug production, he faced opposition from the community, which resisted the introduction of a new drug producer. Unable to create crack or blues, Tyrone explored marijuana. Consumed by the desire to make better products, he experimented continuously, unknowingly developing a dependence on drugs. Despite the money he made, Tyrone found himself involved in a life he hadn't fully understood. He engaged in nonsensical conversations, constantly claiming to experiment with drugs just for the experience. Ren, aware of the street's intricacies, adapted better, while Tyrone, still an amateur, often panicked and succumbed to anxiety. Gradually, Tyrone's interest shifted from cars to underground activities. Ren and Tyrone spent time in rough neighborhoods, indulging in drugs and engaging in delinquent behavior. Though Tyrone tried to present a tough exterior, he was still an inexperienced youth. Sometimes engaging in basketball games at parks, he witnessed freestyle rap battles, which appealed to him. However, despite his enthusiasm for rap music and singing alone, he realized he lacked the talent to become a rapper. One day, while walking on the street, Tyrone found himself caught between two rival sets during a clash. Petrified, he dropped to the ground, unable to move, ignoring Ren's cries to leave. Ren, losing patience, slapped Tyrone to bring him back to reality. They quickly ran away from the scene, leaving Tyrone traumatized. The incident marked a turning point for Tyrone, making him realize the dangers of the lifestyle he had adopted. The intense fear of losing his life in those ten seconds spurred him to reassess his priorities. Although his developed aggressive demeanor disappeared, the damage was done, and the effects lingered. Despite having a significant amount of money, he decided to leave that life behind. Tyrone talked to Ren about changing their lives, and Ren agreed. With this decision, Tyrone, now closer to adulthood, abandoned the immature and reckless life he had been leading.","5":"Tyrone's mother, Delilah, is a woman of mixed race, half-black and half-Brazilian. Her life began in San Bernardino with her sister Betty, but they moved to Los Angeles after their mother's death. Delilah had little money as she was unemployed. She used all her savings to come to the city for a fresh start and rent a home. Her small walks and the $2 coffee she enjoyed were some of the greatest luxuries in her life. During one of her tours to explore the city, she bought coffee and sat on a bench in a bank. Two African American individuals passing by started eyeing Delilah. She noticed this but chose to ignore them. However, the individuals sat on the bench next to her and began making unwelcome remarks. Since it was evening and there were few people around, Delilah began to feel scared. She took her book, stood up, and decided to walk away. As soon as she stood up, the two individuals also got up and started following her. Just then, someone came from behind, hooked arms with Delilah, and said, 'I know you're being followed. Don't be afraid, just keep up.'' Delilah, after an initial scare, felt relieved and allowed the person to lead her away. This person was Cam'Ron Lewis. The two strangers who had been bothering her backed off. Delilah and Cam'Ron, who met for the first time that day, started meeting regularly and eventually became a couple. Following this incident, the Lewis couple quickly decided to get married. They had a modest ceremony on July 7, 1997, at Matrimonio en Los Angeles, and moved to Cam'Ron's house in Compton. Eight months later, Tyrone was born. Both parents seemed to love Tyrone even more than themselves. However, the couple faced significant financial challenges. Cam'Ron, working long hours at the repair shop, had little time to spend with his son. Additionally, the money he earned was not enough for the family. Delilah decided to start working when Tyrone turned one. Since they had good relations with their neighbors, Delilah left Tyrone with their neighbor Jamila while she worked. Delilah's life became tough as she worked cleaning jobs, moving from one house to another, trying to earn money. Despite the challenges, they managed to make ends meet. As Tyrone grew a bit older and started attending preschool, the economic strain on the family increased. They struggled to cover the costs of preschool and daycare, and the parents found themselves too exhausted to give Tyrone the attention he needed. Frustrated with the situation, Delilah decided to talk to Cam'Ron about it. This led to a big fight, and their relationship deteriorated further. Although they lived in the same house, they felt like strangers, with their only common bond being their son, Tyrone. As Tyrone got older and started going to school, he began to learn to do things on his own due to his parents' busy schedules. He also developed a keen interest in Formula 1 racing, bonding with his father over it. However, the family faced a turning point when Tyrone discovered a box of music records in the basement at the age of 10. The records were from N.W.A, introducing Tyrone to rap music for the first time. He couldn't fully grasp the messages conveyed in the lyrics but enjoyed listening to the music. This discovery marked the beginning of his fascination with rap. As Tyrone delved deeper into the rap culture, he changed his dressing style, embracing the Ghetto lifestyle, despite his family's disapproval. His passion for rap grew, and he began writing and memorizing lyrics. Despite his initial reluctance, Cam'Ron supported Tyrone in improving his singing skills, turning it into a father-son bonding activity. As Tyrone turned 11, he started understanding the messages in rap lyrics and identified with the challenges faced by African Americans, strengthening his connection to the culture. At the age of 13, while walking the streets of Compton with his parents, a car blocked their way, and individuals with red attire and bandanas fired shots at them. Tyrone, in shock, witnessed his parents being shot, discovering for the first time that his father was a former Crip gang member. The police labeled it a gang-related murder, and Tyrone's world fell apart. His aunt from San Bernardino arrived to handle the funeral arrangements, offering him a chance for a fresh start. He reluctantly left Compton, moving to San Bernardino, where he met new friends Ren and Rian. Despite initially being unfamiliar with his aunt, Tyrone adapted to his new life. As he grew older, tensions increased with his aunt, who viewed him as a burden. Eventually, Tyrone, with the support of Ren and Rian, made the decision to leave San Bernardino, abandoning his only remaining family.","6":"Tyrone started his school life at an early age because his family couldn't afford a caretaker for him. Due to this, his parents used to leave him with neighbors. As Tyrone grew older, his family decided to allocate some money to send him to a public school. Tyrone began attending kindergarten. Since he was regularly left with neighbors during his early years, he was already accustomed to being away from his parents. Therefore, when he started school, he didn't have much difficulty in being separated from his family. Time passed, and Tyrone started making new friends, developing his social skills. Additionally, he enrolled in the basketball course at kindergarten, attending basketball classes after school on some weekdays. He played basketball both at school and in the nearby park, enhancing his skills. However, when he went out to the neighborhood to play basketball, he met new kids who influenced him with unhealthy eating habits, consuming a lot of junk food and fast food. Tyrone kept eating continuously, leading to weight gain. Due to the weight he gained, Tyrone became a target for bullying at school, being pushed and bullied by other kids. Despite being a small child, Tyrone couldn't endure the bullying and wanted to lose weight, but he couldn't stop eating. Despite everything, he didn't give up on basketball and continued to play. However, due to his weight, he often felt exhausted and sweaty while playing. These situations saddened and angered him. This tormenting period for Tyrone lasted for about 1.5 years. Throughout this time, he endured numerous instances of bullying, and his relationship with friends deteriorated. After 1.5 years, he managed to shed the extra weight through specific training and decided to continue his life in a healthier manner. He devoted more time to basketball, and apart from playing basketball, he continued cardio workouts to stay fit. Despite losing weight, his status at school remained unchanged. He was still considered shy, unknown, and unapproachable. One day, he was facing bullying at school when Ren, the son of his parents' friends, intervened. Though they didn't know each other, Ren warned the bully that if he saw him near Tyrone again, he would break his arms. Tyrone just watched without doing anything, and Ren, being two years older and physically more developed, made an impact. Ren took Tyrone by the arm and suggested they walk around the school together. Ren gave him tactics on how to avoid bullying. They arranged to meet later and went to their respective classes. Ren acted like a brother and mentor to Tyrone, introducing him to new people and helping him regain his lost self-confidence from the bullying period. Ren meant a lot to Tyrone, bringing him out of his shell and essentially bringing him back to life. They played basketball together, roamed the streets after school, and Tyrone started building new friendships. Ren, however, had already developed an interest in rap music when Tyrone discovered his father's records. Tyrone hesitated to sing around Ren, considering Ren's proficiency in rap. One day, during a freestyle session at school, Tyrone jumped in, continuing Ren's verse before anyone else. Though the lyrics weren't great, Tyrone's courage surprised everyone. They freestyled until the break ended and then went back to class. Everything was progressing routinely, and Tyrone and Ren spent more time together on the streets. A few more years passed, and Tyrone turned 12. Ren had already moved on to rap music, while Tyrone, feeling intimidated by Ren's skill, hesitated to sing alongside him. One day, a random car suddenly appeared during a family outing, opening fire on their vehicle. Tyrone hit the ground upon hearing gunshots, and when he looked up, he saw several bullet holes in the windshield. His father passed away on the spot, and his mother succumbed to her injuries shortly after in the hospital. Tyrone, now an orphan, moved in with his aunt Betty in San Bernardino. During the summer months, Tyrone underwent a two-month adaptation period with his aunt. When school started, he began attending the nearby high school. On the first day, he spotted a familiar face. Ren was there. Ren ran towards Tyrone, expressing condolences for his parents. Ren's father had also passed away, and he was living with his mother, taking on household responsibilities and becoming a responsible individual. Ren introduced Tyrone to his school friends, and everyone seemed friendly. The atmosphere was more relaxed and peaceful compared to Compton. Teachers were better, and students were more successful. However, Tyrone had no interest in his studies. He only thought about his deceased parents, and his self-destructive behavior continued. After school, Ren invited him to play basketball on the school court. Tyrone accepted, and they met after school. Among the players, Tyrone only knew Ren. Others played aggressively against him, pushing and shoving him on the court. Tyrone faced a harsh foul, and Ren, unable to control himself, pushed the opponent to the fences. The opponent retaliated with a punch, but Ren remained unharmed and returned a punch. Teachers witnessed the incident, and Ren was sent to the disciplinary board, receiving a 2-day suspension. When Ren returned after the suspension, he appeared calm but had a bruised eye. Tyrone apologized, but Ren knew it wasn't his fault. Nevertheless, Ren wanted to be alone for a while. Tyrone became somewhat arrogant. He constantly teased Ren, not only verbally but also making fun of everyone around him. Ren got annoyed, but he didn't show it because Tyrone was going through a lot. He had recently lost his family and was living with an aunt who didn't love him. One day, while walking in the corridor with school lockers, Tyrone noticed a kid staring at him. He taunted the kid, asking what he was looking at. The kid, aware of Tyrone's habit of mocking others, told him he shouldn't behave that way. Tyrone, however, still didn't care about the kid, who was older than him. The kid got increasingly frustrated and eventually punched Tyrone in the left eye. Collapsing to the ground, Tyrone woke up to find Ren by his side. Ren said, 'I knew this would happen.' Even after that incident, Tyrone continued to mock others, but only those he knew. After 1.5 more years passed, Ren graduated from high school and started working at an auto repair shop. Tyrone endured two more years of going to school alone. He tolerated these two years to make his family proud, but school was boring without Ren. Without friends, it was terrible. After two more years, he graduated on his own, deciding not to go to college. He believed that if he started working immediately, he could achieve more in four years than he would in college. Therefore, he skipped college and started working.","7":"When Tyrone was 12 years old, a girl named Lucy joined his class. Tyrone had never interacted with this girl before. However, one day, she decided to sit next to him. Tyrone, tired from the previous day, had his hoodie pulled over his head, sleeping. Since sleeping was one of his favorite activities, he didn't like being disturbed, but Lucy was not like the people he knew. She didn't leave him alone; instead, she tickled him and waited for him to wake up. Despite initial discomfort, Tyrone warmed up to this girl, who had a similar character to his own. The two became friends, and apart from the times Tyrone spent with Ren, they were constantly together. Being desk mates allowed them to chat during class, and although they got caught a few times, Tyrone started to genuinely enjoy these conversations. With his recent weight loss, he felt good about himself physically and had high self-esteem. Therefore, he was comfortable talking to Lucy. One day, while Tyrone was sitting in the cafeteria, Lucy approached with her lunch tray and sat next to him with a blank expression on her face. When Tyrone asked what was wrong, she revealed that a boy from their class wanted to be her boyfriend. When Tyrone inquired about the boy's name, she mentioned someone named Bob. Tyrone knew Bob, but he wasn't someone he particularly liked. Lucy asked Tyrone about his feelings, but Tyrone was more curious about what Lucy wanted. When Lucy asked him what he thought, Tyrone didn't understand, saying, 'Why does it matter what I think? He asked you out, not me.' Lucy seemed like she was about to say something but simply said, 'You know what? Never mind,' and walked away. Tyrone couldn't comprehend what had just happened. Ren, who observed the situation from a nearby table, approached Tyrone and said, 'I think Lucy likes you.' Tyrone was shocked by this revelation and didn't understand what was going on. He contemplated what he wanted to do. If he said he didn't feel anything for Lucy, it would be a lie, but he wasn't sure about his feelings. He decided the best solution was to talk to Lucy. When he approached her, Lucy avoided eye contact and said she didn't want to talk to him today. The next day, Tyrone's parents died in a car shooting incident, even if Lucy attended the funeral, she couldn't spend much time with Tyrone. They only hugged once, and after that, they never saw each other again. Tyrone realized he was deeply in love with Lucy. Hugging her made him feel better on his worst day. However, he knew he had to move in with his aunt. If he confessed his feelings to Lucy, he would get involved in a bigger situation. Since that day, they never saw each other again. Throughout Tyrone's life, he had one-night stands with a handful of people, but he never felt the same way about anyone as he did about Lucy. No one stayed permanently in his life. Currently, he is content with being alone, not actively seeking anything that would waste his time. However, he misses Lucy a lot.","8":"After becoming an orphan, Tyrone moved in with his aunt. During his stay with his aunt, he aimed to work and not be a burden to her because he thought she might be uncomfortable with his presence. Ren was working at an auto repair shop, but initially, Tyrone wasn't interested in taking up that job. He didn't have a driver's license, so he couldn't work as a courier. One day, while walking down the street, he saw a job ad in front of a pizza place. Despite not being able to ride a motorcycle, he entered and inquired about the job. The owner of the place explained that it was a small pizza delivery job and that a motorbike was not necessary, even a bicycle would suffice. However, Tyrone needed to buy a bicycle. After contemplating the situation, he decided to purchase a bicycle and take up the job. It would not only be a form of exercise but also bring some money into his pocket. Tyrone bought a bicycle with the money left from his parents and started working. Things were going well; he could make some pocket money. However, he started to take the job less seriously and began to annoy his boss. One day, after delivering an order 35 minutes late, his boss yelled at him, saying he couldn't do such a thing at his establishment and tarnish his name. He then proceeded to insult Tyrone's mother. Tyrone, enraged by the insult to his mother, exploded, saying, 'Fuck you, your pizzas, and your shop,' and threw his bicycle at the shop's front window. Despite getting angry and quitting the job, the experience provided Tyrone with communication skills and insights into work life. After being unemployed, Ren asked him why he didn't work at the mechanic shop where he worked. Tyrone explained that there was no reason and that he could work there. Ren pleaded with his boss to hire him, promising to teach Tyrone everything and having Rian help him with technical knowledge. Tyrone got the job and started working. He followed Ren's instructions and never deviated from his word. Although often covered in oil, he never complained. Tyrone worked with Ren at the mechanic shop for a long time. The boss treated him well, as he, too, was black, and Ren and Tyrone reminded him of his own childhood. Despite occasional mistakes, the boss never said anything to Tyrone. Ren had shared a bit about Tyrone's parents' situation. While Tyrone had some basic knowledge about cars, he learned most of the job at the repair shop. After the plans for Los Santos, he hugged his mentor and thanked him for what he had taught. Currently, he is not actively working and is looking for a new job.","9":"Tyrone was born in Compton, spent 10 years there, and later settled in San Bernardino. Both Compton and San Bernardino are places where black gangsta culture thrives, and black hip-hop has developed and emerged. The cities have a higher proportion of the black population. Generally consisting of suburbs, the cities face economic challenges, and the majority of the population struggles financially. Hip-hop culture is prevalent in Compton, with black individuals of all ages typically listening to and enjoying rap music. Many of the greatest black rappers to date have emerged from this environment. Tyrone, from a young age, embraced and started listening to this music culture. He and Ren tried free-styling on the streets. One of the prominent cultures in the area is the Crip and Blood gangs. The enmity between the sets of these two gangs has been known for years. Everyone is in a struggle for survival, and gang activities are high, contributing to a high crime rate. Although Tyrone grew up amidst all this, he has not engaged in any activities related to gangs or gang formation, except for a few fights. Being a gangsta, living like a gangsta is something desired by the majority in Compton. One aspect of gangsta life is the Lowrider culture. People who use old American cars instead of sports cars create a culture emphasizing visual aesthetics by covering their cars with various decals. They enjoy bouncing their cars with hydraulics and driving slowly through the streets. While Tyrone appreciates this culture, he prefers racing cars and fast cars more due to his father exposing him to Formula 1. The social structure in Compton is highly developed. Since the general population consists of Blacks and Latinos, racism has affected this community in the past and continues to do so today. This adversity fosters unity and solidarity among the residents. Artists who have emerged from here often address this issue in their songs. Like every black individual, Tyrone has also faced racism occasionally. The N.W.A. group, which he listened to in his youth, addressed this racism, and as a result, Tyrone has become extremely sensitive to issues related to racism. Illegal Culture: Spending half of his life in Compton and San Bernardino led Tyrone towards street life. After the death of his parents, he found himself occasionally using drugs and marijuana in rough neighborhoods. At one point, he even attempted to grow his own marijuana but failed. Growing up in Compton made him inclined towards this lifestyle. As a very young child, witnessing the murder of his parents in front of his eyes made him feel the need to ensure his safety. To achieve this, he sometimes associated with the wrong people. Despite engaging in various ghetto activities, even drugs became something extremely negative for him. Recognizing his mistake, he decided he wanted to leave this life behind before even fully starting it. Therefore, he does not want to step into ghetto life.","10":"Ren introduced Tyrone to Rian one day. Rian was an old friend of Ren from school. Like Ren and Tyrone, Rian was also a car enthusiast, but he was involved in technical work like Tyrone. Initially, Tyrone found Rian to be very cold and distant, but over time, they became close, and Rian shared all his knowledge with Tyrone. Due to the age difference, Rian and Ren treated Tyrone like a brother and mentor. However, this did not prevent Tyrone from teasing and making jokes about them. Tyrone and Ren started spending more time with Rian, focusing on mechanical and car-related activities, discussing what they could learn and accomplish in these areas. Ren and Rian purchased a scrap car and worked on it together. They attended car meetings in Los Santos, even if they didn't have cars of their own. Experiencing the atmosphere and seeing tuned cars was a great feeling. Among themselves, they often discussed how they could afford such cars and what modifications they could make. One day, Rian mentioned a fair in Los Santos, where they could learn technical things. The trio decided to go to the fair, thinking it would be an opportunity to learn. When they arrived in Los Santos, Tyrone loved the city. It had recently come out of an economic crisis, was recovering, but still faced economic challenges. The people were united, forming strong relationships. The city was unlike San Bernardino or Compton; it felt like everything was just beginning. Although he liked the city, Tyrone returned to San Bernardino, working at the same pace and in the same mechanic shop for a while. After some time, they decided to attend another car meeting in Los Santos. This time, the city had improved a bit more, with more job opportunities. The illegal activities here were not as intense as in Compton and San Bernardino. Tyrone, who was trying to escape this life, fell in love with the city once again. Tired of his aunt's hatred, Tyrone was eager to leave home. He discussed this with Ren and Rian, expressing his desire to do something together. Initially hesitant due to Ren's mother, who didn't want to leave the woman alone, Ren talked to his mother and received her approval. Ren promised to send money to support her. The trio decided to move to Los Santos. With some money in his pocket, Tyrone didn't need to work immediately. They are currently looking for a house to rent with the money they have.","12":"Throughout my life, I have always searched for a job that I could do passionately. In this adventure, I tried various different occupations. One of the ones I enjoyed the most was working with Ren in mechanics. Perhaps I will find a more passionate and fulfilling job for me. However, for now, I want to earn as much money as I can in this short period and live in a good place. I need to work now for the days when I want my life to be comfortable and enjoyable. To achieve my plan for a comfortable life, I need to be wealthy. I want to work continuously until the age of 30 to achieve financial freedom. Besides economic matters, I can't get Lucy out of my mind. It has been over 10 years since then. I want Lucy back. In the future, when I am rich, I want to spoil and entertain Lucy. However, I don't have any communication with Lucy in any way. I am tired of loneliness. If I continue with the mechanical work, I want to become one of the best-known mechanics. I want people to come to my shop just to get certain things done. For this, I first need to own a mechanic shop. However, I don't have the money or experience for that. So, I need to develop myself in this field, find an additional job, and make money for myself. I will work hard and earn my money. I will make a name for myself in the field I love. My current idea is in this direction; whether it will change in the future, I don't know. I don't want to stay on the dark side of the street. I want to completely erase my life in Compton from my mind and not live in that ghetto culture again. I want to meet new people and form new friendships. A new environment is better in every way. I want to completely forget my old life and open a new chapter.","illegal":"Spending half of his life in Compton and San Bernardino led Tyrone towards street life.

On weekends, he follows Formula 1, a sport he became familiar with through his childhood friend Jack. Spending a lot of time with his father's car, he dedicates his free time to maintaining his own or future vehicles. Usually, he hangs out with friends in Irish pubs in the evening, summarizing the day or week over a meal. These conversations have greatly enhanced his social skills and analytical abilities. On special occasions, he engages in new adventures at entertainment venues with his closest friends, meeting new people, or spending time at home playing games like Monopoly, Taboo, or Jenga.","3":"During times of conflict with his family, Dante always feels a sense of indebtedness to those who supported him, especially his friends who assisted him. Consequently, whenever someone he values or loves needs help, he rushes to their aid. Due to ongoing disagreements with his family, he has cultivated a strong sense of loyalty, feeling an obligation to be there for those around him. Being the grandson of a war veteran with a disability, Dante displays great respect and courtesy towards both elderly individuals and those with disabilities. His loyalty extends to his love life, friendships, and family relationships. Inherited from his family, he is careful not to owe anything to anyone, striving not to submit to others and always aiming to stand on his own two feet. Influenced by past arguments with his father, Dante, when making mistakes, acknowledges them, avoids dwelling on them, apologizes when necessary, and steps back.","4":"Chibs family welcomed a new member, and contrary to Mother Claudia's predictions, they decided to name the sweet baby boy Dante. At the age of four, Dante, who physically inherited his mother Claudia's beauty, gave the impression to onlookers that they were seeing a miniature version of Randall in baby form. Randall, Dante's father, saw Dante as his closest friend, watching NBA games together, tinkering with his AE86 while little Dante sat in a corner, observing his father from a distance and enthusiastically cheering with attempted sounds. After finishing work on the car, they regularly took a little tour around nearby places. Father and son played with Dante's small toys, and Randall didn't even want to go to work; he just wanted to spend the whole day with little Dante. However, for Dante to grow up comfortably and for Randall to achieve his life's greatest purpose, he needed to earn money. Dante was unaware at the time that growing up in such a loving family made him incredibly lucky. One day, while Claudia was enjoying a coffee outing with her church friends from the neighborhood, Dante's age-mates came over to their home. Dante, who had a sharing personality from a young age, shared most of his toys with his friends, thanks to the sharing nature he inherited from his father Randall. Due to his sharing personality, Dante became a well-liked and somewhat envied person from a young age. This envy had escalated to the point where some friends were ready to spread false accusations about Dante. Despite having many friends, Dante shared a special bond with one of them, Jack, their neighbor from the adjacent block. From a young age, they played every game together and included each other in every planned activity. These two friends were like brothers from different mothers. As they grew older, their friendship deepened, and their trust and love for each other flourished. Dante introduced Jack to basketball, his favorite sport, thanks to the Philadelphia 76ers and his father. In return, Jack introduced Dante to Formula 1, his favorite sport. The duo attended basketball games together, watched Grand Prix races on weekends, and occasionally went to Go Kart tracks and basketball courts to burn off some energy. The situation had reached a point where Randall started feeling jealous of Jack. Time had passed so swiftly in front of the Chibs family's eyes that it was now time to enroll Dante in school. Randall and Claudia, weighing the potential elementary schools in their minds, were inclined towards The Waldorf School of Philadelphia as their first choice. The proximity of the school to their home and the promises it offered appealed to the Chibs family, leading them to enroll Dante there. However, Dante didn't want to go to school without Jack by his side. Claudia requested her neighbor's consideration for this school, and it seemed suitable for Jack and his family as well. Without much difficulty, they agreed to this school, and these two friends began to spend their elementary school years together. Dante began facing problems due to his appearance early in his school life. He wasn't the only Black student in school, but since he didn't assert himself strongly, other kids would often belittle him. Throughout this, Jack, being by Dante's side, always tried to assist him, even getting into his first fight over these issues. While Jack was talking to the teachers, Dante went to the cafeteria. As he was leaving the line with his lunch, two bullies named George and Kane started taunting him. Dante couldn't tolerate these incidents any longer. His eyes welled up, and his lip started to tremble. At that moment, George pushed Dante, saying, 'Do you want Daddy?' Dante fell on his rear, and the food tray he was holding spilled over him. Dante couldn't hold back the tears, but he was aware that if he cried, he would face even more bullying. Just then, Jack arrived and lunged towards George's neck. The surrounding kids screamed, Dante, with teary eyes, watched Jack in astonishment, and the cafeteria staff rushed to the scene. Before the situation could escalate further, they separated the fight. A cafeteria worker held George with one hand and Jack with the other. When the principal arrived, he let both of them go. Jack, George, and Dante waited in the principal's office, eyes fixed on the floor. The principal had informed their families and scared them by saying if they continued to disobey the rules, they would be expelled from school. Dante didn't want to find himself in this situation with his family. He not only appeared as a coward in school but also had embarrassed his family. He didn't want to experience such an incident again. In the early days of Dante's school life, he was frequently subjected to bullying. Having grown accustomed to this situation, he started retaliating against those who bullied him. When Dante heard that there would be basketball tryouts for the school team in gym class, he got excited. He always wanted to play on a team. Seizing the opportunity, he and Jack signed up together. On the day of the tryouts, George and Kane were also present. This made Dante a bit uneasy as he didn't want to deal with them on such a day. Jack noticed Dante's discomfort and reassured him by placing his hand on Dante's left shoulder, telling him there was no problem, and they would succeed. As the tryouts began, Dante gave it his all. He was anxious, aware that he made a few small mistakes. Thinking he couldn't do it on his own, he went to the locker room. When Jack approached him, Dante couldn't stand still, wondering why he left so quickly; the coach was asking for him, he said. Dante didn't understand what was going on, but he had unwavering trust in Jack, believing that if Jack was happy, nothing bad could happen. Encouraged by this, Dante quickly went to the coach. Although the coach noticed Dante's expression during the tryouts, he first asked if there was a problem. Being aware of the recent incident with George, the coach didn't dwell too much on it to avoid upsetting Dante further. Instead, he chose to talk about Dante's performance in the tryouts. Despite Dante being aware of a few mistakes he made, the coach saw the light and potential within him. The coach said to Dante, 'I'll be expecting you on this court on Monday. Be here at 09:30, and until I arrive, you'll do a death run.' Dante couldn't contain his momentary happiness and excitement; he expressed his joy by thanking the coach and giving a big hug to Jack, emotionally expressing his gratitude. However, a few minutes later, he realized the magnitude of the death run and started sweating. But this minor setback couldn't dampen his spirits. In celebration, Dante and Jack went to Burger King after school and got their favorite 'X-treme Whopper' menu. Dante gained the respect of many due to his successes on the school team, and his popularity at school increased. He no longer faced as much bullying as before, and he had many friends. Dante was pleased with this situation, but there was something bothering him. He couldn't accept having such feelings within himself. This feeling was directed against Jack's success. Jack was a much better player than Dante, and his outstanding performance fueled Dante's determination. Deep down, Dante wanted to surpass Jack, but he was aware that it was something he couldn't achieve. Jack had done a lot for Dante; he was his best friend, but Dante's internal struggles caused him to become angrier every day. He scolded himself and practiced relentlessly. He wanted to outperform Jack, but at the same time, he wanted to control these emotions. He didn't understand these feelings, and no matter how much he wanted to suppress them, he couldn't. He constantly blamed himself, but he was beginning to succumb to his emotions. During games, Dante would display aggressiveness towards Jack and directly confront him when he made a mistake. Jack was somewhat aware of these incidents but couldn't bring himself to confront Dante. He tolerated it, but the more he tolerated, the more Dante pushed back. Eventually, Jack couldn't take it anymore and asked Dante, 'What's your problem? Why are you treating me like your dog?' Dante responded, 'Do you think you're better than me just because everyone's eyes are on you?' Jack stared at Dante with a puzzled expression without responding. Dante said, 'If you think you're better, I'll be waiting for you on the court tonight,' and left the place. In the evening, Jack sent a message to Dante. When Dante saw the message, he was already on the court, and the message simply read '20:00.' He knew he couldn't beat Jack, but he wanted to try. When Jack arrived at the court, he didn't say anything, just left his belongings under the basket and walked straight onto the court. Dante threw the ball towards Jack, and the match began. Jack completely dominated Dante. Dante knew this would happen, but he couldn't control himself. All he could think about was not letting their friendship suffer. After the game, lying on the ground, he apologized, saying, 'I didn't want it to be like this, but I couldn't control myself. You know one day I'll surpass you.' Jack smiled and replied, 'Come on, you'll never surpass me,' extending his hand to help Dante up. Despite a brief strain in their friendship, they quickly returned to their old camaraderie. They both realized that this rivalry was making them stronger, and it suited them both. Putting aside their jealousy, they began to support each other even more. After a while, the final match was approaching. They set out as a team for the semi-final match in New York. Everyone in the team was in incredible solidarity, their only desire was to make their school proud. Finally, the big day had come, and the Emma Lazarus High School basketball team was preparing to reach the finals. The match, where excitement was at its peak, had begun. Randall and Claudia were sitting side by side in the spectator section. It was one of the proudest moments a father could experience, as Randall felt. In the first quarter, the Emma Lazarus High School team was in the lead. Taking advantage of the period break, the team made a tactical change. They positioned Dante as a shooter in the front. Finally, Dante had the opportunity to showcase himself to his father. In the middle of the second quarter, Dante found a dunk opportunity from a very narrow angle. Attempting to score by jumping two steps forward, Dante fell to the ground after a strong body contact from a bulky player on the right side. Randall, driven by paternal instinct, rushed to the court to check on Dante. Although Dante's condition seemed fine at first, he had suffered an injury that would prevent him from playing basketball again. This situation deeply saddened Dante and even led to him falling into depression. The match continued after Dante's accident, and the Emma Lazarus High School team emerged victorious. When they returned home, Dante didn't want to talk to anyone. Both his family and Jack, as well as the team coach, wanted to talk to Dante, but only his father succeeded in doing so. For Dante, basketball had become something he could only watch on TV from now on. Due to the recent incident, Dante still felt a sense of shame. For someone so popular in his school, this incident was more than a minor setback. Randall had received an offer that would require him to oversee the opening of new branches in Los Santos. The offer was too good to resist, but Randall was not selfish enough to make a decision without considering his family. Although Claudia initially resisted a bit, she eventually provided her support. Dante, still unable to forget the incident he experienced and suffering from the pain of not playing basketball, was informed about this decision by Randall. He pondered over it for a long time. Ultimately, he believed that moving away would be a logical decision. Even if it meant being away from his closest friend Jack, he couldn't continue his life in this state. He needed to make the most rational decision for himself, and that decision was to relocate. After all, in the age of technology, they could always stay in touch. Before leaving, Dante expressed his gratitude to the team coach, teachers, and friends. Dante, who enrolled at Los Santos Davis High School, learned that there was a football team at the school. Viewing Los Santos as a second chance for himself, Dante wanted to return to playing basketball. His first task was to talk to the team coach and try to get himself enrolled. However, the team was already full, and Dante had to prove himself under these circumstances. Spending every spare moment in the school's gym, Dante tried to catch the coach's eye. Due to this focus, Dante neglected his studies and didn't make much effort to improve. The basketball incident still lingered in a corner of his mind. He had dedicated himself entirely to sports. Coach Lewis noticed Dante's determination and ambition, considering him for the backup position on the team. Dante was over the moon about this opportunity and was determined to do his best not to let the team down. Slowly but surely, Dante started to connect with people on the team and at school. He felt the absence and longing for the popularity he used to have. Trying to engage in conversations with a few like-minded individuals he had in mind, Dante attended parties, didn't miss events, and often came home very late. This situation, of course, made Randall and Claudia uneasy, but they chose not to say anything to their cherished child and empathized with him more. These experiences were not easy for Dante. Firstly, the end of his basketball career, and on top of that, the change of city presented considerable challenges. Perhaps Dante was putting in so much effort to escape from all of this. One day, while wandering through the school corridors, Dante saw Russell and Dave sitting side by side. Since he had some prior interaction with them, he wanted to spend some time with the duo. Russell and Dave were introverted and quiet, so Dante felt a bit sad and wanted to help them open up. Invited to a party that evening, Dante also wanted to invite these two. Initially hesitant, Russell and Dave couldn't resist Dante's insistence and agreed to come. Requesting his father's AE86, Dante went to pick up Russell and Dave from their homes. As they got into the car, Dante tried to start a conversation with a few questions. However, Russell and Dave were extremely excited as it was their first time attending a party. Arriving at the front of the house where the party would take place, Dante was greeted by Betty. After introducing Dante to the uninvited guests, he asked Betty about the atmosphere inside. Betty replied, 'Go in and see for yourself; you'll love it.'

As time passed, the two became even closer, and their friendshipevolved to the next level. Dante and Gemma attended classes together, spending almost alltheir timetogether both during and after university. They lived in the same house for a period, and they werealmost certain they would spend their lives together. The two were deeply in love and inseparable. Astheir graduation year approached, excitement grew for both of them. They envisioned living togetherafter university. However, they had separate dreams. Dante planned to move to Los Santos aftergraduation, while Gemma wanted to go to places over the ocean, to Europe. Although the two tried toavoid the topic, Gemma's dream was significant to her since childhood, making her adamant about notgiving it up. One night, they planned a romantic dinner to discuss their post-university plans. Gemmawould cook the meal. When Dante returned home from school, Gemma had already prepared the meal.Since Gemma had cooked, it was Dante's responsibility to set the table. The evening started veryromantic and enjoyable, but as they discussed their plans after university, things took a turn for theworse. Dante and Gemma, both individuals not willing to submit to anyone since childhood, got alongvery well because of it. The argument became increasingly heated. Neither of them was willing to backdown. Dante, thinking that if he stayed any longer, his relationship would become irreparable, grabbedhis coat, left the room, and jumped into his car. He drove aimlessly on the roads until sunrise, trying toclear his mind. He returned home around 8 in the morning, but Gemma was nowhere to be found.Instead, he found a note hanging in front of the mirror. The note said, 'I love you more than anything,but not enough to give up my own dreams. Take care of yourself.' Dante dropped to his knees, the whitepaper becoming transparent in his hands due to wetness, disappearing between his two hands. Dantestayed in that position for about half an hour. When he finally got up, he picked up his phone and triedto call Gemma. The phone wouldn't ring; it automatically went to a busy signal. His first action was togoto the university, ask Gemma's friends about her, and check all her favorite places. Despite his efforts, hefound no clues. Desperate and sad, he spent the entire night visiting Gemma's favorite spots, his formerdorm room, and all the nearby hotels. Still, there was no hint. Dante returned home feeling hopeless anddepressed. He lay in bed and didn't leave his room for a week. At 1:17 PM, Dante opened his eyes, gotup, looked in the mirror, and couldn't recognize who he saw. He grabbed his electric razor, razor blade,and foam carelessly, and began to shave his beard in a haphazard manner. After finishing with theelectric razor, he threw it aside and began to shave with a blade, indifferently. His face was irritated andeven bleeding, but he didn't care. Setting the lukewarm water, he took a shower, got dressed, andbefore even drying his hair, he jumped into his car, heading towards the university. Everyone wholookedat him reacted as if they had seen an alien; their facial expressions were not even what they would showto a homeless person. Dante searched for Gemma all over the campus. Still no results. While he wasthere, he decided to attend a class. However, entering the class didn't change anything; he set his headon the desk and started dozing off. After class, he quickly returned home and began the same routine,only to sleep. However, he knew that he couldn't graduate this way. If he couldn't graduate, it would bein vain that he lost Gemma. So, one night, he lifted his head, dedicated himself solely to hisstudies, andachieved passing grades in every subject.Finally, graduation day arrived, and Dante was eagerly searching for Gemma. He had kept going with thehope of seeing her on graduation day for months. However, Gemma was nowhere to be found, and noone knew where she was. Dante was on the verge of losing his mind, but he managed to stay calm as hisfamily was with him. All he wanted was to quickly receive his diploma and go out one last time to searchfor Gemma. Students went up to the stage one by one, received their diplomas, and left. It was Dante'sturn. He went up to the stage, quickly read a thank-you message, expressed his gratitude to his family,and left. He handed his diploma to his father, saying he had an urgent matter to attend to, left theschool, jumped into his car, and went in search of Gemma. However, it was in vain; it seemed as ifGemma had disappeared into thin air. No one had any idea where she could be. Late at night, Dantereturned home, utterly exhausted. Randall hadn't slept until Dante came home, and he was extremelyworried, almost considering calling 911. When Dante arrived home, he knew he had a lot to explain.They sat in the living room, and Dante shared everything that had happened with his family, whobecame his confidants. A few weeks later, Randall and Claudia returned to their home. Dante stayed inSan Francisco for a while, wrapping up unfinished business.","8":"One night, when Dante returned home very late from a party, he was met by his father, Randall. SeeingDante arrive at around 2:00 AM, Randall, deeply disappointed, scolds his son. Randall, who had neverraised his voice at his son before, was now extremely upset. He did not want his son to have such alifestyle. However, Dante, in the peak of his adolescence, begins to argue with his father in a similarmanner. Fueled by anger, Dante jumps into his father's car and heads to the home of a friend who livesalone, intending to spend the night there. When morning comes, realizing his mistake, Dante decides togo home to apologize.As Randall is at work at that hour, Dante cannot enter the house and decides to spend some timeoutside. He calls Russell on the phone to invite him to hang out. Russell, bringing Dave along, joinsDante. The three friends go to a coffee shop, where they engage in conversation. Dante shares theevents of the previous night with his friends, describing a similar, more intense experience thathappened to Russell. Due to this, Russell supports Dante. During this time, the camaraderie between thethree friends grows. After a while, feeling bored, they hop into the car and head to an Atari Arcade toplay games.However, the time quickly passes, and it's close to 11:00 PM. They hurriedly get into the car and drivetowards their homes. Meanwhile, at home, Randall, sitting in front of the television, is still waiting,hoping to see his son enter through the door. As it approaches midnight, losing hope, Randall preparesto go to bed. Just then, he hears the sound of the door opening, and to his surprise, Dante is there.Aware that he needs to apologize, Dante is about to speak when Randall, overwhelmed with anger morethan the previous night, starts yelling at Dante. The calm demeanor Dante had in the morning hasdisappeared. In a similar fashion, he is now shouting back at his father, unable to bear it any longer.Unable to endure the situation any longer, Dante quickly pulls the door, steps outside, gets into the car,and drives away. Asking for a few more days of permission from the friend he stayed with the previousnight, Dante sets out on the road. For Dante, who is quite proud, even the act of wanting to apologize inthe morning was a significant event.A few days had passed since the incident, and Randall was still trying to reach his son. He waited at theschool gates, talking to all of Dante's friends, striving to get any news. Meanwhile, Dante had embarkedon a part-time job search. He wanted to stand on his own feet. Starting to work as a waiter in arestaurant, Dante had to juggle between school, the school team, and his job. He felt relieved for notgoing to school for a few days, but eventually, he had to return. When he returned to school, he couldn'tfind the time he wanted, so he had to make a choice. He chose to continue his education and job byjoining the school team. He had now put an end to his sports career.Slowly getting his life in order, Dante had already started helping his roommate with the rent. He hadparked his father's favorite car in front of his old house, leaving the key in a hidden compartment. Hehad become a strong young man who could stand on his own two feet. However, it was still not enough.Graduation was approaching rapidly, and he needed to save money to go to college. Accumulating suchan amount on his own in such a short time was impossible. Therefore, he decided to put college on theback burner and planned to focus on his first goal: graduating from high school. By finishing high school,he aimed to secure a good job.After a while, graduation time had finally arrived. Initially hesitant about attending the graduationceremony, Dante later changed his mind and decided to participate. Dante was sure that he would seehis father and mother at the ceremony. Trying to avoid conversation as much as possible, Dante's heartwas filled with sorrow upon seeing his family after a long time, and after the graduation, he ran to them.Both sides acknowledged their mistakes and had a civil conversation. After graduating, Dante movedback to his father's house. After completing high school, Dante, with the help of his father, found atemporary job to save money for college. Although his father offered to help him financially multipletimes, Dante was determined to stand on his own feet. Dante worked at a gym for a while, accumulatinga substantial amount of money for himself. ","9":"Philadelphia native Dante, having lived a middle-class to upper-middle-class life, had plenty ofopportunities for self-improvement in a city rich in history. Large portions of Philadelphia encompassedghettos, and the city's overall structure was dominated by gang life. However, due to his familybackground and opposing views towards this environment, Dante chose to ignore these lifestyles.Randall, having witnessed these ghettos in his childhood, was determined to keep Dante away from thislife, ensuring that he stayed far from Philadelphia's rough areas. The general economic balance inPhiladelphia was divided into rich and poor, with distinct neighborhoods for each. Dante consideredhimself fortunate due to his place of residence; had he been born in the ghetto, he might have beendrawn into that illegal life. As he progressed and developed, he distanced himself from theseneighborhoods. In his childhood, he admired their way of life because, in some aspects, he consideredthem superior. They didn't follow rules, did whatever they wanted, and no one could insult or be racisttowards them; they would surely show you what they were made of. Despite hearing about suchincidents frequently in his early school years and sometimes encountering them in back alleys afterschool, Dante refrained from stepping into that lifestyle due to his place of residence and his courage. Ashe grew older, he realized that such a lifestyle would only confine him behind bars and separate himfrom his family.Dante constantly heard about gang life in the early stages of his school years and initially accepted thisculture. However, as he grew older, he realized that making a lot of money didn't have to involve crimeor robbing people. By completing his education, he could step out of this culture and potentially earnmore money. Gradually, he began to look down on those who embraced this culture. People whoembraced this culture felt compelled to do so in certain circumstances, but Dante believed that everyonedeserved a second chance.Since infancy, Randall had been exposing Dante to basketballs and his beloved car, which Dante hadnaturally embraced as hobbies. As he got older, Dante began researching the histories of these items. Hisfirst researched car was his father's AE86, a car that Dante had fallen in love with. As he delved into thehistory of this car, he discovered the world of races, car meets, and drifting. Watching videos hestumbled upon during his research repeatedly, he tried to understand what was happening. He learnedthat cars were classified by countries and realized that his preference was for Japanese cars. Themodifications made to Japanese cars, the focus on drifting rather than drag races, and the vibrant andeventful car meets strongly resonated with him. He kept posters of these cars hidden in his desk cabinet.Saving his school allowances, he began collecting Lego sets and miniatures of these cars, creating asmall-scale collection. He constantly asked Randall questions about the car and requested to be taken fora drive. The sound of the engine starting took Dante to a different universe every time.Dante has embraced basketball culture throughout much of his life. However, after his injury, hedeveloped a resentment toward this culture and gradually distanced himself from it.Due to Dante's ever-changing ideas, he couldn't fully commit to a specific culture. What seemed logicaland compelling one day appeared dull and foolish the next. Since he wasn't forced into any particularculture, he lived a pressure-free life, and only his own opinions mattered to him. He could only upholdcar culture, as it was the only one he could fully embrace. This culture had so many branches that oneday he might be following Formula 1, and the next day, he could be immersed in drift battles. ","10":"Dante, having lived in Philadelphia for a while, moved to Los Santos thanks to a job invitation for hisfather. He spent his high school years here and formed all his friendships. Viewing this place as a secondchance due to the unfortunate basketball incident in Philadelphia, he quickly developed an affinity forthe city. Los Santos had a special place in Dante's heart, where he enjoyed his friends, team, coach,nightlife, and almost every moment of his life. When he had conflicts with his family, needed adistraction, wanted to spend time, or felt bored, the city was always there for him. He experiencedalmost all his firsts here – first date, first kiss, first girlfriend, and first career. As he approached hisuniversity years, this city was still on his mind. However, after a major fight with his family, he realizedthe importance of standing on his own feet, even if just a little. He couldn't ask his family for more help.Considering different cities and universities in his mind, he decided to work towards earning his ownuniversity expenses. Despite reconciling with his family at graduation, Dante wanted to save money forhis university independently. Randall respected his decision, and together they started looking for a job.After finishing high school, Dante, with his father's help, found a temporary job to save money foruniversity. Although his father often offered financial assistance, Dante was firm in his decision to standon his own two feet. He worked at a gym for a while, accumulating a decent amount of money.Dante, having saved enough money to pay for his university expenses, embarked on a quest to find asuitable university. His initial plan was to attend the same university as his father. However, he laterdecided that he wanted to explore different states, travel, and stand on his own feet by going to anotherstate. San Francisco, a state he had always wanted to visit and explore, was in a corner of his mind asPlan A. Plan B was Los Angeles. When the application period opened, he applied to the University of SanFrancisco, and his other application was to UCLA (University of California). With great excitement, hewrote his essays. One morning, he went to check his mailbox during his usual routine and found twoletters that caught his eye. One contained a rejection, and the other held an acceptance letter. Heopened the letter from UCLA first and unfortunately saw the rejection. Nevertheless, this news didn'tupset him too much because it meant that he was accepted to the University of San Francisco, his firstchoice and goal. With joy, he went to his parents to share the good news. The Chibs family had anextremely pleasant morning breakfast, and Dante, filled with excitement, quickly went shopping for hisuniversity. Although there were still a few months until the university opened, they began preparationseagerly.During his time at the university, his sole dream was to return to his city after completing his studies andbecome successful. Los Santos was the only thing on his mind during this period. After completinguniversity, he returned to Los Santos, finished the pending tasks, and rented a hotel room. ","12":"Childhood teachings from his family always emphasized independence and strength for Dante. Althoughhe excelled academically, Dante's true passion was basketball. While living in Philadelphia, Dante had asuccessful basketball career, at least within the school. However, due to an unpleasant incident, he felt asense of shame. When he moved to Los Santos, he attempted to join the basketball team at the schoolhe saw as a second chance. However, he lacked his previous discipline, and basketball had turned intomore of a personal pastime. He wasn't studying or heeding his family's advice. His unruly behavioreventually led to conflicts with his family, and in a fit of anger, he made decisions he would later regret.It became clear that he needed to stand on his own two feet. From that point on, during times when hewas alone, he learned how to survive independently.When he started university after finishing high school, this trait served him well. He consistentlymanaged to stand on his own feet, enjoying a successful and enjoyable university life. He had fun withfriends, found the love of his life, and dedicated time to his hobbies. He never gave up on his dreams,even for Gemma, whom he considered the love of his life. For this reason, he broke up with his girlfriend.After graduating, he moved to Los Santos.Breaking up with Gemma had deeply saddened me, and I was still under its influence. I stayed in myhotel room, only lying on my bed and staring at my phone. When I got bored, I would open a movie onthe TV, but I couldn't even finish watching it before closing it again. A person in a vegetative state mighthave had more activity than me. This went on for a while.Then one morning, I woke up feeling different. I was extremely bored; I wanted to go out, have fun, andexplore. I reached out to some friends I had met during my time in Los Santos. Some had moved to othercities and countries, but Dave was still around. I hopped into a taxi and went to meet Dave. We hadlunch together at a place and then went to an arcade to play games. I realized that engaging in suchactivities was better than sitting in my hotel room staring at the wall. It was time for me to get better.First, I started looking for a job where I could earn some money. I took on temporary jobs, and somemoney started trickling into my pocket. I was paying for my hotel, buying myself nice clothes, going totheaters and cinemas, and enjoying good times with my friends. Life had turned around for me, and Iwas thoroughly enjoying it. However, this wasn't enough for me. I needed to earn more money because Ihad a goal in mind.My dream was to buy a Kanjo and turn it into a show car. I've always been a fan of motorsports, be itFormula 1, drift competitions, or rallies. The action, high-speed revolutions, and drama had alwaysdrawn me in. I wanted to build a show car for myself, a car that everyone in a neighborhood or on aboulevard would look at and take pictures of. Kanjo was the perfect vehicle for this, with its affordableprice and widely available parts. I was determined to use all my efforts to achieve this dream.After realizing my car goal, I want to focus on easier and more lucrative jobs. As the money in my bankaccount grows, I aim to escape from this cursed hotel room and buy a beautiful house in the lowerVinewood Hills. I want to be a likable personality in my community and have friends who can help me.During my time in Los Santos, I remember seeing a few racing groups when I went out with my friends atnight. I might want to try my Kanjo too. Kanjo was my first car, and it was low-budget. When I have astable life again, I want to get myself a Pfister, preferably the latest models. I want to participate ingo-kart races with my friends, play basketball, and organize various activities. ","fear":"One day, while reading a book alone at home, Dante developed a strong aversion and fear towards arachnids after spotting a large spider crawling on his wall. In addition, he has an innate phobia of reptiles. He avoids standing at high places and experiences uneasiness whenever he looks down from a considerable height, as if fearing he might fall. Although not as intense as a phobia, this situation internally scares him. Having been a well-liked personality among his friends since a young age, Dante occasionally faced false accusations, causing him to fear being slandered and unable to explain himself. Due to his grandfather being a war veteran, Dante harbors a deep hatred for war. He believes that his country would declare a state of emergency at the slightest international incident and fears the possibility of being forced into war. During his youth, a friend with a 125cc motorcycle invited Dante for a ride. Accepting the offer, Dante and his friend set out to tour the most enjoyable places in the city. On a straight boulevard, approximately 700 meters before the traffic lights, a vehicle entered the road from the right without signaling from the blind spot. Dante's friend, unable to react instantly, was involved in an accident that, although not severe, could have caused injuries. Since that day, Dante has not ridden any motorcycle again.","negative":"Dante has a tendency to magnify nonexistent events in his mind, creating unnecessary drama and turmoil. He manages things according to his own thoughts, often keeping his actions to himself without informing those around him, and can suddenly find himself in a completely different situation. During times when his mind is cluttered or when he feels upset, he may turn to alcohol, potentially exceeding the limits. While he is generally capable of admitting his mistakes, there are instances where he can be stubborn, pushing things to the limit and refusing to back down. He struggles to forget his former lover and true love, Gemma, and finds it challenging to move on. The premature end of his sports career, particularly in basketball, can evoke a sense of sadness, even triggering frustration when the topic is brought up. Being on the same basketball team as his closest friend, Jack, since elementary school has instilled a sense of competitiveness and a constant desire to excel and prove himself in Dante's personality."},"loid":{"1":"Loid stands out with fair skin, black straight hair, and dark brown eyes.

One of my favorite activities is following National Hockey League (NHL) matches in NorthAmerica. Among the Japanese teams, Oji Eagles has always been the team I like the most. I admiretheir teamwork and competitive attitude in the league.At the age of 13, I started swimming at my family's request. I quickly joined a small team throughtryouts. After about a year of swimming, I struggled with breath control and constantly fell ill dueto the pool water, so I stopped swimming on the team. Now, swimming with loved onesoccasionally relaxes me more than swimming for competition.Taking care of animals feels therapeutic to me. I inherited a love for animals from my family. Duringmy high school years, I greatly enjoyed volunteering at animal shelters. Later on, I adopted a catfrom the shelter. Taking care of Hera brings me a lot of happiness. Hera is currently living in Japanwith my family.I enjoy collecting. Owning all the pieces in a series brings me joy. I started collecting by gatheringthe manga series I read in middle school. The first manga series I collected was One Piece.I'm afraid of fish, and their images inexplicably disturb me. That's why I don't enjoy swimming inthe sea and try to act as if there were no fish around. I prefer swimming in pools. I struggleimmensely with eating fish. After starting to eat Salmon Nigiri, my stomach starts to feel queasyafter eating one or two pieces. Instead, I prefer meals that don't contain fish.I'm hesitant and fearful of meeting new people face-to-face. I usually can't take the first step inmeeting someone. That's why people tend to describe me as introverted.Because I'm a sensitive person, I tend to place a lot of importance on people's thoughts. That's whythere are times when I can be too hard on myself.","3":"I constantly strive to empathize because situations where people's thoughts are often disregardedbother me. That's why I can't help but empathize when someone is in a difficult situation. I'memotional; what people say and events I experience deeply affect me. I tend to attach a lot ofimportance to events and individuals.I am loyal; I never turn my back on people I trust and love. I would never subject someone toexperiences I wouldn't want to live through myself.I am tolerant; I respect differences and accept people as they are. Being of Asian descent, I cansometimes be seen as different among many people and can face racism.

I prefer moving withnew ideas, which I owe to the activities my mother made me do at home when I was younger.I have an honest personality because, since childhood, I've tried not to involve lies and deceit in mywork and friendships, taking my father as an example.I have difficulty focusing on events, and my attention gets scattered. I can experience distractioneven when talking face-to-face with someone. This has caused me to receive reprimands from mymath teacher constantly.As a perfectionist, I believe everything I do must be the best. While perfectionism sometimes helps,most of the time, it leads to a stressful life for me.I doubt every action people take. I question whether there's a hidden agenda behind every action.Not having many friends can be a disadvantage for me due to this.I struggle with expressing my emotions in interpersonal relationships. I'm not antisocial because Idon't want to socialize; it's because I struggle to take the first step with people.I'm impatient; I don't like waiting and prefer things to be resolved as quickly as possible.","4":"Loid was filled with curiosity and an eagerness to explore from the moment he was born.

Loid, wrapped in awarm blanket, peacefully slept in his mother's arms. Loid's room had a simple decoration, arrangedaccording to the needs of baby Loid. The baby crib, colorful toys, and baby items were scatteredaround different corners of the house. Loid's room was a special corner for the family, adornedwith cute animal figures and colorful frames on the walls. The house was often filled with babyLoid's cries, laughter, and the toys he tried to explore.

During this time, the family was focused on Loid's growth and development. Day andnight, they assisted Loid, eagerly awaiting his first steps and words. The home held many happymoments centered around baby Loid. Loid, encouraged by his family, tried to take his first steps ona soft carpet. Holding on, he steadily moved his small feet forward.

During preschool years, Loid started exploring the world throughgames. He enjoyed making pictures with colorful crayons, leading to his family framing thesecreative moments on the walls. Additionally, he liked listening to various stories and retelling themin his own way. Little Loid didn't have many friends; the only peer he saw was the boy named Yukifrom the upper floor.

Loid's educational life was challenging. The most influential people in Loid's life werehis family and Kira. Kira taught Loid how to withstand difficulties. The people Loid met throughcomputer games had the most impact on his life. Loid found it difficult to talk to and meet newpeople. Computer games were his only social space. People who had never met him liked Loid,which made him less inclined to make friends in real life. Kira and Daiki were enough for him.Besides his friends, when volunteering at shelters, Loid adopted a cat named Hera. Taking care ofHera distracted him from his problems. After dropping out of high school, Loid met his friend Haruat the workplace, becoming an integral part of his life. Loid got along very well with Haru.

Weighing55 kilograms, Hikari, born and raised in Osaka, completed her high school education despite herfather being a tradesman, and later began working at their small store to assist her father. Theirstore, like most markets in Osaka, operated 24/7. One night, when her father fell ill, Hikari tookover the night shift. That night, a tall, black-haired man arrived at the store, looking to make apurchase. After picking up some ready-made food and a drink, he asked Hikari to heat it in themicrowave. Hikari obliged and engaged in a conversation with the man, who introduced himself asYami Suzuki.

After heating her own meal, they sat together on the chairs outside the store.Yami's dark brown eyes seemed to sparkle as he conversed with Hikari. After the meal, theycontinued their conversation. Yami shared that he lived in Tokyo, worked as a lawyer, and was intown for a case.Their conversation lasted until the early hours.

Even before Loid's birth, Hikari had arranged everything necessary for the baby.Their biggest wish for their son was for him to study well and pursue a fulfilling career. Theyconsistently tried to assist Loid in his education. During his childhood, Loid took his father as a rolemodel. Yami was one of the few lawyers who practiced without lies and deceit, and although hisincome wasn't high, he was content with being an honest lawyer. Personality-wise, Loid resembledhis mother the most, as he spent more time with her. Hikari advised Loid to empathize with others.At a young age, she engaged in activities with Loid to foster his imagination. They often wenthorseback riding on their days off. Loid grew up surrounded by animals. As Loid had a fear of theseas, his family enrolled him in a swimming course. He excelled in swimming, joined a team, andprepared for competitions. However, due to respiratory difficulties while preparing, he couldn'tcompete. Constantly falling ill from ingesting too much water, Loid stopped swimming after a year.Due to the continuous support from his family, Loid felt pressured to excel in everything he did.Striving for perfection caused him emotional distress. During his high school years, he faced stresstrying to prove himself to his family and resorted to using gastric medication due to exams. Feelingacademically unsuccessful and seeing his father's financial struggles, on his 18th birthday, Loidexpressed his desire to drop out of high school to his family.

His mother,Hikari, accompanied him to the school gate, trying to support Loid in making new friendships. Heeagerly took his seat, waiting for the class to start. When Loid started primary school, he facedsome difficulties in his studies. Particularly, mathematics was quite challenging for him. Faced withnumbers and problems, he sometimes felt helpless and struggled to understand some concepts.One day, in a math class, the teacher embarrassed him in front of the class for not being able to dohis homework. Loid felt embarrassed and had to confront his own limitations. He had attentionissues, making it hard for him to focus on lessons. Some kids in the class took advantage of this,teasing him, while others excluded him. This significantly shook Loid's self-confidence. Alongsidethe challenges in his studies, the bullying from classmates was quite distressing for him. At times,he didn't want to go to school and hesitated to share this with his family. While dealing withbullying and academic challenges, Loid met Kira, a smart and friendly girl in the class. They foundcomfort in sharing their difficulties and supporting each other, often spending time together. Kirahelped Loid with his math struggles, provided extra tutoring, and encouraged him. However, thisfriendship led to them being ostracized in class. Some other students envied their supportive bondand began to exclude them. This resulted in both of them facing bullying and being ridiculed bysome children. When Loid shared this with Kira, she encouraged him to stand strong against thebullying. Together, they decided to face the exclusion together. However, this situation sometimesaffected their inner worlds. Both Loid and Kira shared the pain of being excluded, trying to uplifteach other's spirits. When Loid and Kira moved on to middle school, classes got mixed up, and thephase of making new friends began. One day, during a math class, they noticed a lively andcheerful boy laughing loudly in the class. His name was Daiki. Daiki immediately caught everyone'sattention with his humorous and energetic demeanor. His jokes and sudden pranks alwaysattracted a crowd around him. Loid and Kira immediately liked Daiki's friendly and genuineattitude. They spent time together during lunch breaks and recess. Daiki's funny and entertainingways lifted both of their spirits, alleviating some stress from difficult classes. He supported Loid'sstruggles in math with a humorous approach and offered morale along with Kira. The trio enjoyedspending time together, forming a friendship around common interests. Daiki's humor and energybecame a new breath of fresh air in their middle school days. In the final years of middle school,Loid's performance in exams became critical. Due to constant illnesses, he decided to give upswimming. Missing classes due to illness exacerbated the difficulties in subjects like math andscience. During this period, exams became more crucial, marking a turning point for Loid'sacademic future. In the first set of exams, Loid struggled a bit but managed to succeed througheffort. However, in the second exam period, a health issue prevented him from fully grasping thecontent of a few subjects when he needed to focus more on his studies. On the day of the exam,Loid was unprepared and anxious. Realizing he wouldn't be able to answer most questionscorrectly, he experienced significant stress. When the exam results were announced, he barelymanaged to pass.Eventually, Loid, Kira, and Daiki graduated from middle school. In their country, high school wasn'tmandatory. Daiki and Loid didn't consider going to high school due to their academic struggles.Kira, having finished middle school as the top student, insisted that both Daiki and Loid shouldattend high school. Their families also wished for them to finish high school. Feeling compelled,Daiki and Loid started preparing for the entrance exam. Finally, the day of the exam arrived. Kira,Loid, and Daiki assured each other they would do their best and took the exam. After the exam,they went to an internet café to play games together. They had overcome this challenging day onceagain. Weeks later, the exam results were out. Kira's score qualified her for all the high schools shedesired. Loid and Daiki scored quite close to each other and were accepted into a mediocre highschool together. Meanwhile, Kira was soon to attend a prestigious high school. They would seeeach other less often.Loid and Daiki found themselves at the high school they got into. However, the atmosphere wasslightly different from what they had expected. The school predominantly housed students fromlower-income backgrounds and had limited resources. This situation negatively impacted students'motivation and the overall school atmosphere. Daiki immediately became a social personality fromthe first day of school. His humorous demeanor and quick connections with people formed a circleof friends around him swiftly. During breaks, he conversed with students, joked around, and easilycommunicated with everyone. On the other hand, Loid was quiet and reserved. He kept hisconversations in class to a minimum, usually focusing on other things. The general atmosphere ofthe school and the behavior of the students influenced him, making it difficult for him to formsocial connections. Loid mostly spent time alone. Although Daiki occasionally tried to approachLoid, Loid usually remained silent and avoided conversation. While this allowed Daiki to maintainand expand his social circle, it led to Loid living a more introverted life. Loid missed Kira.Additionally, the stress of struggling in classes led him to start using antacid pills in a short amountof time. They were returning home together on the same route after school. While Daiki drewattention with his outgoing personality in high school, he had started to interfere in therelationship between Loid and Kira. He was trying to cast some shadow over his friendship withKira. Daiki occasionally engaged in friendly conversations with Loid and made negative commentsabout Kira. Although Loid tried to understand the underlying reasons behind Daiki's behavior, heusually remained silent and hesitated to explain the situation to Kira. Meanwhile, Kira began to feeluncomfortable with Daiki's attitudes and decided to share the situation with Loid. Daiki, in anattempt to create a rift between them, was trying to make Loid worried by saying things like 'I thinkKira is tired of you, she doesn't seem to want to hang out with you anymore.' Such statementscreated doubt and uncertainty in Loid's relationship with Kira. Kira noticed Daiki's attitudes andclearly expressed his attempts to harm the friendship with Loid. However, this situation causedtension among the trio and undermined Loid's trust in Daiki. He wasn't considering talking for along time. Loid felt he couldn't cope with the difficulties at school and had decided to confide inKira, feeling extremely stressed. One day, when meeting Kira, he was tired and visibly worried.Sitting down, he lowered his head and began to speak.'Kira, I've been struggling a lot at school lately,' said Loid, his eyes filled with sadness. 'The classesare too heavy, my grades are low, and I don't know what to do anymore.'Kira looked at him with concern and tried to be supportive. 'Loid, everyone feels this way at times.But I believe you can overcome these difficulties instead of giving up. You are strong, and you canget through this.'Loid wanted to explain that his troubles weren't limited to just his studies. 'Also, things aren't goingwell between me and Daiki. Something's wrong, and I'm having a hard time dealing with it.Sometimes I feel lost in this situation.'Kira tried to understand Loid's feelings and make an effort to support him. 'Maybe you both needsome time. What matters now is trying to overcome these difficulties together. I'm here for youand ready to support you anytime.'After a while, things began to change when Daiki hinted at his feelings for Kira. Daiki revealed hisfeelings through a letter he secretly wrote to Kira. However, this letter mistakenly ended up inLoid's hands. Reading the letter, Loid evaluated the situation with a mix of surprise and concern.Daiki's feelings for Kira started to make sense to him. He realized that these feelings weremotivating Daiki to disrupt the relationship between Loid and Kira. A few days later, Daiki'sbehavior began to change. He started feeling more jealous towards Loid and began to display amocking and disdainful attitude towards him. This situation heightened Loid's inner conflicts,causing him to question his relationship with Kira further. Meanwhile, Kira noticed Daiki's changingbehavior but struggled to understand the situation. Their relationship and Daiki's attitude towardsLoid increased tension within the trio. Finally, the summer vacation arrived.The summer vacation gleamed under the hot sun, providing a chance to alleviate some of thetension between Loid, Kira, and Daiki. One day, the trio decided to meet at a sunny park. FollowingDaiki's suggestion, they spread a picnic blanket and sat around it. Loid felt it was the right time totalk in this relaxed atmosphere. 'Friends, there's been some strange tension among us lately,' hesaid. 'And I wanted to discuss this.'Kira nodded, showing support. 'Yes, indeed. It's important to understand and resolve this situation.Tell us, what do you think?Loid continued, looking at Daiki. 'Daiki, I want to understand what's between us. You've beenacting strangely lately, and it's affecting me.' Daiki hesitated for a moment, then took a deepbreath. 'Actually... I have feelings for Kira that I need to admit. But I shouldn't have hardened myattitude towards you for that. I'm sorry, Loid.' Loid appreciated Daiki's openness and apology. 'Iunderstand, Daiki. It can be hard to hide your feelings. But what matters is respecting each otherand resolving this.' The trio decided to enjoy the comfort of speaking the truth and expressing theirfeelings today. They took a step towards improving understanding among them and spending amore peaceful summer vacation under the sun in the park. Daiki, Kira, and Loid spent much of theirtime together, enjoying pleasant moments during short vacations and weekends. However, Loid'sinner conflicts persisted. One day, as the trio sat and chatted in the park, Loid decided to share histhoughts. 'I'm still undecided about leaving high school,' said Loid. 'It's hard being under so muchstress with my studies and future plans.' Kira looked at him with concern. 'Loid, we have concernsabout you, but if there's a better option for you, we'll support you.' Daiki shared his thoughts.'Maybe finding a more suitable path for you is important. It might take some time, but whatmatters is your happiness.' Loid appreciated his friends' understanding and support. 'I apologize forworrying you about this. If I can sort out the complex emotions inside me now, I'll be fairer to you.'The trio decided to postpone further discussions on this topic and spent their days together. Loid'sprocess of resolving inner conflicts was ongoing, but with the support of his friends, he felt morecomfortable and at peace.Yami had been practicing law for many years, with an average career, but things hadn't been goingwell recently. The decrease in cases at his office and financial instability caused difficulties for thefamily. One evening, Yami sat with his family around the table, determined to speak seriously.'Things haven't been going well lately. I've been losing many cases, and our workload is decreasing.Unfortunately, I'm facing some financial trouble.' Hikari looked at him with concern. 'Yami, we'rewith you. We're a family and we can solve these problems together.' Loid nodded quietly. Yamiappreciated his family's support, but the concerns still lingered. 'Thank you for your support.Maybe we'll struggle for a while longer, but if we work together, we can overcome these issues.'Loid had finally made the decision to leave high school. He didn't see an academic career path forhimself. He had been waiting for the day to tell his family about this. July 13th was Loid's 18thbirthday, and the family had gathered to celebrate this special day. However, Loid's internalconflicts and the family's financial difficulties cast a shadow over the celebrations. Loid decided heneeded to express his feelings to his family. Amidst a happy atmosphere, with everyone gatheredaround the table celebrating Loid's birthday and exchanging gifts, Loid seemed lost in thought for amoment. Finally, he began speaking, addressing everyone sitting around the table. 'Dad, Mom,today has truly been a wonderful day, and I thank you all for being here,' said Loid, taking a deepbreath. 'However, there's something inside me that I need to share with you. I don't want tocontinue my high school education.' Hikari and Yami looked at him in surprise. Loid continued, 'Iknow about the difficulties we're facing as a family, and I want to support our family. Maybe I canstart working by leaving school and contribute to our family's financial situation.' The family triedto understand Loid's feelings and needed some time to accept his decision. However, Loid's love forhis family and his desire to help had a deep impact on them. After hearing about Loid's decision toleave high school, his family came together for a deep conversation. Hikari started with aconcerned expression. 'Loid, your education and future are important to us. However, we respectthe decision you've made. If this is what you want, we'll support you.' Yami added, 'Maybe we canfind another way. Perhaps we can make a plan together and explore options like work orinternships.' Loid felt relieved with his family's understanding and supportive approach. 'Thankyou, really. With your support, I want to get through this process.' The family decided they woulddo their best to support Loid's decision and move forward with him. This decision not onlystrengthened family bonds but also gave them a new perspective on Loid's future. One day, whilehanging out with Kira and Daiki, Loid found an opportunity to bring up the topic again with hisfriends who were already aware of his decision. As the trio sat in the park, it was time to revisitLoid's situation. Loid took a deep breath and began speaking. 'You remember the financialdifficulties my family and I have been facing. You know I want to leave high school. I've talked tomy family, and I won't continue my high school education.' Kira nodded understandingly. 'Yes, weremember. We're here to support your decision. Daiki, with a serious expression, said, 'Maybe wecan find a solution together.' Loid thanked his friends for their understanding attitude. 'Yoursupport means a lot to me. I'm sure we'll get through this together.' The trio had reaffirmed theircommitment to support Loid in this situation they had been previously informed about. Theirfriends' understanding strengthened Loid's determination to help his family. With school reopeningsoon, Loid met Kira and Daiki again. Loid felt it was time to step into a new direction after leavinghigh school. On the day of their meeting, Loid explained his situation to them. 'Friends, I've lefthigh school, and now I'm a bit unsure about what to do next,' said Loid. 'I want to support myfamily, but at the same time, I want to find something new for myself.' Kira, thoughtfully, said,'Maybe you could look for a job or take up a hobby. Perhaps an internship could be beneficial foryou.' Loid nodded back and forth, 'I'll consider all of these, thank you.' As they walked hometogether, Loid sat at his computer and began researching job postings and hobby opportunities.Hoping to find something that could help his family at home or something aligned with hisinterests, he browsed through various pages. While examining job listings, Loid was also looking foropportunities to acquire a new hobby. Ideas like trying sports or learning to play the guitar,suggested by Kira and Daiki, were on his mind. After a while, he came across an interestinginternship opportunity and an advertisement for a guitar course. 'Maybe doing an internship andlearning to play the guitar could be a good idea,' he thought to himself. As he considered hisfriends' suggestions, he continued to explore job listings and hobby courses. Balancing the desire tofind a job where he could support his family with the wish to pursue a new hobby, Loid prioritizedfinding a job for now rather than starting a new hobby like playing the guitar. Therefore, he setaside the idea of a guitar course and continued to review job listings. Hoping to find a job thatrequired specific skills and could help his family, he considered options like home-based work oronline sales representation. He also researched job opportunities related to online lessons. Jobsrequiring social interaction were less appealing to him due to difficulties in social communication.Finally, he stumbled upon a job advertisement. It was a job posting for a warehouse worker at astore called UNIQLO. Loid clicked on the ad and looked into the job. He was glad to have found ajob that seemed suitable for him. He immediately called the number provided in the contactsection to inquire further. They arranged a job interview for Loid. He couldn't wait to share thenews with his parents about arranging the job interview. He was accepted for the job shortly afterand asked his father to teach him how to drive. His father agreed to Loid's request and taught himhow to drive.","7":"Loid had a platonic crush on a girl in the neighboring class during middle school. He was hesitant totalk to the girl he admired platonically and often kept his feelings inside, thinking why someone likeher would talk to him. The girl he liked changed schools a few weeks later. Loid lost the chance totalk to the girl he had a platonic crush on without even learning her name. Later on, besides hisclosest friend Kira, he couldn't get close to any other woman. Kira, saddened by Loid's situation,constantly tried new things. Despite Kira attempting to set him up with friends a few times, Loiddeclined as he didn't feel ready for a relationship. As a result, the incident between Kira and Daikidistanced Loid from relationships a bit more. He planned to wait until he found someone suitablefor himself. After leaving high school, Loid spent all his remaining time from work playing computergames with friends from other countries and with his colleague Haru. During this time, Loid wascontent with his situation and didn't consider being in a relationship. Until he moved to Los Santos,Loid had grown used to being alone. Moving to Los Santos to take care of his grandfather andlosing him due to cancer had some negative effects on him. After arriving in Los Santos and losinghis grandfather, Loid felt extremely lonely. Even his friends and family weren't around, whichplunged him into depression. Loid felt emotionally empty and was seeking someone he could trustor a group of friends. He still struggles to connect with people and spends time alone because hedoesn't like himself and finds it difficult to initiate interactions. However, he holds onto thepossibility of someday meeting people who truly care for him or finding a partner who might bringhappiness into his life","8":"The day Loid had been waiting for finally arrived. Loid came prepared to the UNIQLO store for thejob interview that would take place. He was excited because he had no previous work experience.In the room where the interview was held, he met with the employer or human resourcesrepresentative. The HR representative greeted Loid warmly and started explaining the details aboutthe job. 'You applied for a position as a warehouse employee. This position involves organizing theinventory in our store and handling storage processes.' This was the first time Loid listenedattentively. The representative continued, 'Responsibilities include maintaining warehouse order,checking shipments, and inventory tracking. You will be working flexible hours on certain days ofthe week.' When Loid had the chance to express himself, he said, 'This position seems like a greatopportunity for me to support my family. I believe there's a lot I can learn from you and your team.'After the interview, Loid returned home and joyfully informed his family, 'The interview went reallywell! I got accepted to work at UNIQLO as a warehouse employee!' The next day, he went to theUNIQLO store to start his new job. The employer or training supervisor showed him around theworkplace and introduced him to his colleagues. Loid was trying to adapt to the new workingenvironment and focused on learning the responsibilities required for the job. He began learningthe details of the job such as warehouse organization, inventory tracking, and shipment controls.On his first day, he didn't interact much with his coworkers. Nevertheless, he was trying to fit intothe team spirit. At the same time, he was determined to support his family and fulfill hisresponsibilities to the best of his abilities. Though the salary wasn't high, it was one of the best jobshe could find. After his first day, he came home, sat at his computer, and called Kira and Akirathrough a voice chat. He told his friends that he's not just an 18-year-old high school studentanymore, but a working adult. He was happy to share this news with his friends. After talking withKira and Daiki, he went to bed to rest for a while. After fiddling with his phone for a bit, he fellasleep. Some time had passed. Loid had been working at his new job for more than a month. Hehad supported his family with his first paycheck. Everything was going as he wanted. He had evenmade a friend at work, Haru. Haru was a 20-year-old guy with whom Loid constantly joked and hadfun at work. After work, they used to go out for something to drink and return home together. Haruoften talked to Loid about his dreams and cars. Initially, Loid had no interest in cars or any futureaspirations. He felt like he was just existing. Haru kept sharing car-related things with Loid on socialmedia, but Loid couldn't continue the conversation because he knew nothing about cars. After awhile, Loid decided to do some research about cars. He started with different types of vehicles andwatched many videos and read books about cars. Cars were incredible machines that started tocaptivate Loid's interest. One day, after work, Haru invited Loid to his place. Loid didn't refuse thiskind invitation and accepted it. He informed his family and went to Haru's house for dinner. Haru'shouse was a small and traditional Japanese home. Loid had a nice dinner and met Haru's family.Afterwards, Haru said, 'There's something I need to show you,' and took Loid by the arm outside.They were walking towards a wooden area resembling a clubhouse. Loid was curious about whatHaru was going to show him. Haru unlocked the door. They went inside, and Loid realized that theplace resembling a clubhouse was actually a garage. Inside, there was an old and damaged car. Loidasked what it was. Haru said, 'This car you see belonged to my grandfather, a 1978 model Datsun280Z.' Loid was looking at the car. It was evident that he didn't understand anything. The car hadbeen neglected for a long time and had rust in many places. Haru chuckled and asked Loid tosearch for a 1978 model Datsun 280Z on his phone's internet browser. Loid searched and found thecar. He said the car was really beautiful and asked Haru why he held onto it. Haru said he neededmoney for the warehouse job, so he started working at UNIQLO. Loid asked Haru why he wanted torestore the car. Haru said it was a legacy from his grandfather, and his grandfather and father hadan accident in this car. They lost his grandfather in that accident, and his father didn't like the carfor that reason. So, Haru wanted to restore the car as a memory of his grandfather. Loid wastouched on behalf of Haru. He started feeling proud and respectful towards his friend. Loid saidthat his own grandfather lived alone in Los Santos and was a retired police officer. He mentionedthat he last saw his grandfather when he was 9 years old and hence had many memories.AfterHaru and Loid had a chat in the garage, Haru dropped Loid off at his home. Loid had a routine in hislife now. Even though it was a monotonous routine, Loid was content with his job.A few months later, Loid had drifted apart from his high school friends Kira and Daiki. Kira had goneabroad for university. Although Loid and Kira occasionally talked on the phone, their old intimacywas no longer there. Daiki had found a new group of friends and started a new job. When Daiki andLoid crossed paths, they exchanged greetings and went their separate ways. Since Haru was Loid'sonly close friend during this period, Loid spent most of his free time playing computer games athome. He started saving money to go abroad like Kira. Loid still didn't have any dreams or goals,and he was still searching for something to aspire to.A few days before his 20th birthday, Loid received bad news from his father. His grandfather livingin Los Santos had been diagnosed with colon cancer. His family was already tense due to anongoing crisis, and his grandfather's illness dealt a severe blow to them. They couldn't decide whatto do as a family. After talking to his father, Loid accepted a significant responsibility to go and helphis grandfather. The family was unable to come to a decision due to the crisis caused by hisgrandfather's illness. After discussing with his father, Loid agreed to go and help his grandfather.The next day, Loid bid farewell to Haru and left his job.","9":"Loid grew up in Japan, immersed in his country's culture. Traditional Japanese music played with instruments like Gagaku and Shamisen was Loid's mother's favorite, and he grew up listening to songs performed with these instruments during his childhood. Loid and his family enjoyed wearing traditional garments like Kimono and Yukata on special occasions, cherishing their cultural significance. However, one aspect of Japanese culture that Loid didn't quite appreciate was the prominent place of fish products in the cuisine. Despite being 179 centimeters tall, taller than Japan's average height, Loid found himself standing out. Like many in Japan, Loid began reading manga and watching anime at a young age, eventually building a collection of his own. His favorite time in Japan was during cherry blossom season when he would go on picnics outdoors with his family. Yet, one aspect of his culture that he couldn't quite adjust to was the habit of making sounds while eating ramen or similar meals. This custom, indicating enjoyment of the meal, felt a bit discomforting to Loid, though he understood it was a way of expressing satisfaction with the food. Once he started working, Loid developed a fondness for following Japan's car culture through magazines.","10":"Loid's grandfather, residing in Los Santos and experiencing hardships due to a crisis, was diagnosedwith colon cancer, leaving Loid and his family in a difficult situation. Initially, Loid's father, YamiSuzuki, expressed his intention to go. However, after discussing the matter, Loid himself insists ongoing. This decision will help alleviate his sense of responsibility towards his family, at least tosome extent. Loid quits his job and bids farewell to his closest friend, Haru. He starts packing hisbelongings to move in with his grandfather. He takes the savings he had accumulated whileworking, possibly to use them if he plans to go abroad later. Once Loid and Yami complete theirpassport procedures, Loid begins waiting for the day the passport will arrive.Loid has concerns weighing on his mind. He knows the money he's brought along will sustain themfor a while, but he starts worrying about finding a job once that money runs out. Overthinkingbegins to stress Loid out, so he pauses thinking about it and starts wondering about hisgrandfather's condition. After a few days, Loid's passport arrives, and he's ready for the flight. Theyhead to the airport with his family. Unexpectedly, Loid encounters Haru, waiting there for one lastgoodbye. Tears well up in Loid's eyes, and he hugs his friend tightly. After bidding farewell andhugging his family, Loid passes through the international departure gate with his suitcases.After checking in his luggage, Loid boards the plane. Once the plane takes off, he puts on hisheadphones, closes his eyes, and begins reflecting on his experiences. Shortly after, Loid fallsasleep. Spending most of the journey sleeping, Loid's plane finally begins its descent toward LosSantos Airport. After disembarking, Loid retrieves his luggage and hails a taxi waiting across theroad. He directs the driver to his grandfather's house, describing the location. The city looksnothing like Tokyo; there's no hint of Tokyo's misty atmosphere. Loid finally arrives at hisgrandfather's house, rings the doorbell, and his grandfather opens the door, surprised at how muchLoid has grown. Tears filling his eyes, Loid embraces his grandfather tightly, expressing how muchhe missed him, recalling that he last saw his grandfather when he was 9 years old. His grandfathertakes Loid to his room, showing him around, allowing Loid to settle in and rest on his bed for awhile.","12":"After losing my grandfather shortly after coming to Los Santos, I truly found myself in a deadlock.When my family asked if I would return to Japan, I was indecisive. After thinking about it for awhile, I decided to stay in Los Santos, stating that I could stand on my own two feet. After talkingwith my family and putting my grandfather's house up for sale, I could afford to rent a motel roomwith the last money I had. I'm even happy to have a place to sleep at night. I started researchingjobs I could do to earn money. During this short time I spent with my grandfather, I now speak thelocal language fluently enough to meet my needs. I aim to do whatever job I can to earn moneyand prove to my family that I can stand on my own feet. I used to think I would never go fishingbecause I'm afraid of fish. But now, I've even started thinking about fishing to earn money.Being alone made me start thinking constantly, making me feel like I'm in a void. It bothers me notto have anyone to talk to. My only goal is to regain that monotonous routine that most peopledon't like. I aim to buy myself a car and an apartment. I now want to make friends who will loveme again, like Haru did. As difficult as these desires may be, I am ready to strive for them and proveto my family that I am someone who will not waste their efforts."},"bennao":{"1":"Ben Nao Kylian is someone with green eyes, fair skin, and medium-length chestnut hair.

","4":"Ben Nao Kylian was born on January 6, 2002, in Tokyo, Japan. He adopted the name 'Ben' from hisgrandfather, Benjamin Kylian, and the name 'Nao' at his mother Yua Kylian's request. Growing up inShibuya, Ben was a quiet and calm child. Witnessing constant verbal disputes and being caught betweenintense parental fights throughout his childhood always kept him distant and cold towards his parents.Due to his mother's Japanese cultural dishes, Ben developed a dislike for them, resulting in him being athin and average-sized child.Despite wanting to spend time with his parents like other children, the intense conflict between BobKylian and Yua Kylian prevented this. Ben Nao Kylian constantly experienced cultural conflicts during hischildhood. While spending time with his mother, he learned about Japanese culture, and with his father,he experienced a completely different culture and behaviors. This experience led to Ben Nao Kylianexhibiting inconsistent cultural behavior when in the same environment with his parents, receivingdifferent reactions based on his behavior.The challenging and conflicting life of Yua and Bob Kylian was a result of Bob Kylian's move from NewYork to Japan due to work and his struggle to embrace Japanese culture. Ben Nao Kylian's greatest andmost loved hobby during his tumultuous childhood, which helped him cope with loneliness, was readingbooks. Despite the bilingual education at home, he had a strong passion for reading, with the first bookhe read, 'In Praise of Shadows,' increasing his desire to read. The reason was that the book depictedcultural conflicts and the constant search for light amidst darkness and despair.Even in the early years of elementary school, Ben continued to experience loneliness, being ostracizeddue to different facial features from other Japanese children because of his American father. In the lastyear of elementary school, he met Morimoto Tetta, who became his closest friend, helping himovercome loneliness and start socializing. Spending time with Morimoto somewhat made Ben forget thefight-filled memories with his family. Ben, along with Morimoto and Morimoto's sister Mina Tetta,formed a close trio, frequently attending arcade halls or karaoke events with friends after school.Although Ben initially didn't enjoy these activities, he eventually developed a habit of participating inthem.Despite his fear of heights, Ben frequently visited Tokyo Tower with his friends at their insistence. Whiletrembling with fear at the top, Ben tried not to show his fear due to the presence of the girl heliked.However, despite his attempts to conceal it, Mina and Morimoto noticed and teased Ben jokingly. Thissituation didn't upset Ben, as he was accustomed to such words and teasing from his close friends.A week before starting high school, Morimoto's uncle taught Ben magic and sleight of hand skills.Although Ben didn't know the purpose of these skills, Morimoto mentioned that he learned them fromhis uncle, who was involved in theft, a conversation Ben overheard when Morimoto spoke to his father.Ben considered this dangerous and unnecessary. A few days later, Ben accompanied his uncle Yuji to theTokyo Daikoku car meet event and was fascinated by what he saw. Noticing that his uncle was engagedin showcasing the car for sale rather than for show, Ben realized he wouldn't be able to afford such a careven if he saved for a long time. This harsh reality shook Ben, and he remembered Morimoto'ssuggestion. Ben called Morimoto, suggesting that they use these skills but in a way they desired.Ben talked to Morimoto and made a decision: they needed to save money, and he could use these skillsduring high school. After deciding, Ben Nao Kylian and Morimoto spent their three years in high schoolstealing accessories and electronic items from other students and selling them. Despite not being able toeat Japanese food like Morimoto and Mina, Ben lost weight due to inadequate nutrition after leavinghome.Ben continued his life in Japan with Morimoto and Mina until the incident with his uncle","5":"The life of Yua Kylian and her father, Bob Kylian, was filled with arguments almost every day. The reasonsbehind the challenges and conflicts in the lives of Yua and Bob Kylian were rooted in Bob Kylian's movefrom New York to Japan due to work and his struggle to embrace Japanese culture. Bob Kylian went toJapan to pursue his university master's degree and get a better education, with the intention of returningto New York. Although he went to Japan for education, Bob Kylian met Yua Minori the moment helanded at the airport. Yua Minori assisted Bob Kylian in exploring and getting to know Japan. Influencedby the tolerant, understanding, and beautiful behavior that he hadn't encountered for a long time, BobKylian decided to take his friendship with Yua Minori to the next level and proposed to her to be his lifepartner a few months later. Despite knowing that her family would disapprove due to the heavyadoption of Japanese culture, Yua Minori accepted the proposal after contemplating for two weeks.Yua Minori's family strongly opposed the marriage, but despite the potential family issues, Yua Minoriand Bob Kylian decided to get married, taking on the challenges. After marriage, Yua Minori startedworking at her father's tea house, where she faced teasing and verbal provocations every day due toaccepting the marriage proposal. While the marriage started well, it began to deteriorate after the birthof Ben Nao Kylian. Ben Nao Kylian, as a child witnessing parental fights and intense conflicts, found itdifficult to get close to his parents. Every small decision leading to arguments resulted in Ben growing upas a passive child, unable to express his desires to his parents. Despite being hungry due to his dislike forthe Japanese cultural dishes his mother prepared, Ben would push the food aside and go to his room toread books.Bob, noticing Ben's reluctance towards Japanese cuisine, would take him to American fast-foodrestaurants after dinner, trying to bridge the gap in their relationship. Spending time with hisgrandfather as requested by his mother, Ben initially thought he found someone who could distract himfrom the family situation, but he was disappointed after meeting his grandfather. Ben, with an egotisticalpersonality, tried to prove himself to his grandfather but was met with disapproval in every skill andaction. Realizing that even his grandfather's inherent behavior didn't please him, Ben expressed to hismother that he didn't want to see his grandfather anymore.Yua Kylian, aware that the strained relationship was a result of her own marriage decision, believed thattime would heal their relationship. Though Ben didn't believe in it, he agreed to spend more time withhis grandfather as per his mother's request. However, disappointment struck when Ben realized hisgrandfather's disapproval persisted despite his efforts. Associating his grandfather's behavior withJapanese culture, Ben distanced himself from Japanese culture.Amidst family conflicts and his grandfather's rejection, Ben found solace in spending time with his closefriends, Morimoto Tetta and Mina Tetta. Forming an inseparable trio, they navigated through theirschool years together. While Morimoto embraced American culture despite coming from a Japanesefamily, Mina, spending time only with her mother, embraced Japanese culture. Despite the challenges,Ben's life took a positive turn as he bonded with Morimoto and Mina during high school.After graduating, Ben completely distanced himself from his parents while maintaining his trustlessrelationship with them. His sole source of joy was spending time with Morimoto and Mina. On NewYear's Day, Bob Kylian was called to the office by his manager just before leaving work. The managerinformed Bob that he had some money but needed Bob to hide it from his wife. Promising a promotion ifBob succeeded, the manager mentioned that Bob would get promoted once the money was returned.Unaware that he left some of the money in the office safe, Bob went to home with metro.Morimoto and Mina were planning a surprise birthday party for Ben's 18th birthday at midnight.Morimoto called Ben in the afternoon, inviting him to join them at a bar later that evening. Despite notremembering his own birthday due to celebrating alone every year while his parents were occupied, Benaccepted Morimoto's invitation, having no other plans. As Ben entered the bathroom to get ready, heheard the phone ringing in the living room. Checking the phone, he noticed it was his father calling andshouted, 'Dad, they're calling from your workplace!' Bob Kylian came out of the bedroom to take thecall, and after answering, he returned to the room with a concerned expression.The manager had called to ask Bob to return the money, but Bob, unaware that he left some in the safe,agreed to bring it back. Bob opened the drawer where he had hidden the money and began counting it.As he noticed the shortage, anger made his hands tremble. He immediately suspected Ben of stealing,recalling a past incident at school. Bob stormed into the living room, accusing Ben of taking the money.Yua Kylian and Ben tried to understand what was happening, but Bob was too focused on demanding themoney back.Upon realizing that Bob wouldn't believe him, Ben explained the situation, recounting his past theft atschool and how he had refrained from such actions since then. Despite Ben's explanation, Bob continuedto accuse him and compared him to his mother, calling him a liar. Witnessing the argument, Yua Kylian,frustrated with her husband's lack of attention to the warnings she gave during their marriage, decidedshe couldn't stay in the house any longer. She opened the door and left, choosing to return to herfather's house.Seeing his mother leave infuriated Ben, but he didn't utter a word in response. Frustrated with theinjustice he faced, he left the house in anger, walking towards Tokyo Tower, crying all the way. Unable tobear his father's lack of trust and the unjust situation, Ben decided he would no longer have anyrelationship with his father. Sitting on a bench in Shiba Park near Tokyo Tower, Ben contemplated hisoptions.Mina, noticing Ben's distress, approached him, listened to his story, and reassured him that everythingwould be okay. She, along with Morimoto, suggested that Ben could live with them, assuring him thatthey knew him since childhood and wouldn't judge him for his family issues. Although the idea of goingto Los Santos to live with his grandparents crossed his mind, Ben found the proposal of living withMorimoto and Mina more appealing. He considered the possibility of his grandparents reacting similarlyto his grandfather and discarded that option.Ben spent a year living with Morimoto and Mina, experiencing Japanese culture intensely with a familythat embraced it. While he appreciated the aspects of Japanese culture his father taught him, headopted habits and moral principles that made more sense to him. During this time, he reluctantlyaccepted financial help from his mother, damaging his self-esteem and reinforcing the perception thathe was always dependent on others.Ben occasionally spoke with his uncle Yuji Minori, a reserved person, and despite spending little timetogether, they had enjoyable moments. However, Yuji became the only person Ben despised after atragic accident that took Morimoto's life. Yuji's careless actions led to the death of Ben's close friend, andfrom that moment, Ben considered his uncle an enemy.As Ben Nao Kylian's life unfolded in Japan, marked by family conflicts, rejection, and moments of solacewith friends, he faced a pivotal moment when he decided to sever ties with his father and sought refugein the companionship of Morimoto and Mina. ","6":"When Ben Nao Kylian turned 4, his father told him it was time to start preschool. His mother, however,opposed the idea of preschool, arguing that Ben could learn the necessary skills at home and should startprimary school at the age of 6. Every decision within the family resulted in arguments. Although Ben feltupset about this situation, he couldn't voice his opinions. By the time Ben turned 6, his parents began aprolonged search for the right primary school. His father insisted on a school named 'ES' in Tokyo,mainly for its focus on English and language development. However, disagreements persisted in everydecision. Ben's mother, like many others in the family, wanted him to attend Jinnan Elementary School.The decision was ultimately settled through a heated argument, and Ben started his primary school lifeat Jinnan Elementary School.Due to his partial American heritage, Ben faced isolation from other children at school. Some kids evendisplayed racist behavior towards him because of his eyes. Despite the sadness, Ben believed thatremaining quiet would spare him from troubles, just like during the conflicts at home. In his first year ofprimary school, Ben focused solely on his studies. He aimed to excel in academics, thinking it wouldprevent his parents from hearing anything negative about him. Determined to finish the remaining fiveyears of primary school, he dedicated himself to academics and excelled in swimming at the school'sgym.After a four-year gap, Ben Nao Kylian is now in the 5th grade of primary school. Throughout this period,he made short-lived friends, but small disagreements led to continuous exclusion. On the first day ofschool in April, Ben barely made it to school on time due to rain. During a break, he went to the schoolcafeteria with the hope of trying new meals, but, as every year, the menu remained the same. Aftergetting a drink, he sat by the window to enjoy his drink and read, listening to the raindrops hitting theglass.Shortly after, a blond boy approached and asked, 'Can I sit here if the table is empty?' Although Benpreferred not to be disturbed while reading, the politeness and respect instilled by his mother compelledhim to say there was no problem with the boy sitting. While keeping his eyes on the book, Ben brieflyglanced at the boy who sat at his table, realizing he was Morimoto Tetta from his own class – a boyknown for his foul language. Ben was surprised that a boy with such a reputation would ask politely tosit. Morimoto started coming every day for a few weeks, eventually sitting without asking for permission.However, he never engaged in a conversation with Ben.Feeling troubled by this situation, Ben sought advice from his parents during dinner, asking, 'A kid fromschool sits at my table every day for lunch, but he never talks to me. What should I do?' Both parentssynchronized in their response, saying, 'You should ask him.' Seeing his parents agree on somethingafter a long time made Ben happy, and he welcomed their suggestion.The next day, Ben struggled to wake up, thinking all night about how to ask Morimoto. When he finallyarrived at school, he waited for Morimoto in the cafeteria during the usual break time. Engrossed in hisbook, he realized he was almost finishing it. Although reluctant to be disturbed, Ben heard Morimotosaying, 'Hello.' Oblivious to Morimoto's presence due to his concentration on the last pages of the book,Ben finished reading, put his hands together on his head, and said, 'Finally, it's done.' Morimoto, afterhearing this, greeted Ben again. Responding with a simple 'Hello,' Ben listened as Morimoto explainedhe had been waiting for Ben to finish his book for about three weeks. Ben agreed, relieved that he nolonger had to ask Morimoto why he hadn't talked to him.Morimoto, now Ben's closest friend, brought color and enjoyment to Ben's school life. Understandingwhy people spoke with foul language became clear to Ben after becoming close friends with Morimoto.Morimoto switched to a different speaking style when dealing with strangers, reserving his bluntlanguage for those he knew well. Ben gradually got used to Morimoto's informal way of speaking, whichplayed a significant role in their deepening friendship.A few days later, Morimoto came to the cafeteria and told Ben about a plan, inviting him to join.Although Ben had never done such activities before, he accepted without much thought, knowingMorimoto was a fun person to be around. After school, Ben went to Yoyogi Ōyama Park and waited forMorimoto. To his surprise, Morimoto arrived with a girl. Although initially unsure if it was Morimoto,seeing him with a girl made Ben think otherwise. Morimoto approached, performing an Americanhandshake Ben had learned from his father, and explained that the girl, Mina, was his sister. Ben,reassured that Morimoto's sister was likely to be as fun and humorous as Morimoto, felt more at ease.Ending the day with friends in a lively and enjoyable manner, Ben, on his way home, saw a group ofchildren riding bikes. Feeling sad and dejected, thinking that riding a bike was impossible for him, Bencontinued walking slowly. Upon entering the house, Ben's father noticed something was wrong, calledhim over, and asked about the problem. Ben mentioned the kids on bikes, and his father, with a smirk,said, 'You shouldn't worry about such small things, my child.' He instructed Ben to wait after school thenext day.The following day, Morimoto expressed a desire to hang out after school, but Ben explained that he hadto wait for his father and couldn't join. After school, Ben waited in front of the security gate, and soonheard a bicycle bell. Turning around, he saw his father walking his bike towards him. His father, reachingBen, said, 'I told you not to make small things a concern.' Ben, now happy that he could ride a bike toschool, felt a bit embarrassed for not knowing how to ride. His father lifted Ben's chin, asked if hethought those who ride bikes knew how to do it instantly, and Ben, wiping his eyes, agreed, saying,'You're right, Dad.' With his father's support, Ben learned to ride the bike and happily cycled home.After a few weeks of practicing alone, Ben had mastered riding the bike and joined the neighborhoodkids in bike races, winning magic charm prizes. The praise and respect he received from the kidsenhanced his competitive spirit, making Ben more confident and proud of his achievements.Ben Nao Kylian learned to drive at an early age with his grandfather. Struggling to get along with hisgrandfather, Ben found it challenging to express his frustrations and objections during the process oflearning to drive. He eagerly anticipated the day he would have his own car. On days when he couldn'ttolerate his grandfather's behavior, Ben would suggest going fishing and spend time fishing together.After a three-year gap, Ben transitioned from Shoto Elementary School to Shoto Junior High School.However, this transition led to him distancing himself from friends, experiencing a similar sense ofloneliness as he did in elementary school. Morimoto and his sister Mina also moved on to Shibuya JuniorHigh School, making it difficult for Ben to meet them frequently. Feeling disconnected from his friends,Ben sought to spend time with his family. Unfortunately, he couldn't think of an activity that both hisparents would enjoy due to frequent arguments and disagreements between them. This situationgradually drove Ben away from his parents, and he couldn't find time to meet Morimoto and Mina.Focusing on his studies and sports in middle school, Ben developed an interest in volleyball. He spent hisafternoons alone in the gym, practicing running and volleyball. Kenta Takeda, the captain of the ShotoJunior High School volleyball team, noticed Ben's dedication. Despite receiving an offer to join the schoolteam, Ben declined, knowing he would leave the school after one more year. Nevertheless, he continuedindividual sports and workouts, contributing to his growth. This activity played a role in his increasedheight.As Ben moved on to high school, still two months away from starting, Morimoto messaged him.Morimoto expressed a desire to meet, stating it was an important matter that he couldn't discuss withanyone else. Although Ben couldn't decipher the meaning behind Morimoto's message, he was quitecurious. He replied, offering to meet and asking about the issue. The next evening, Ben and Morimotosat on a bench near Tokyo Tower. Morimoto began explaining that a few days ago, his uncle had comehome late, handed a bag to Morimoto's father, and when Morimoto's father investigated it in hisabsence, he found jewels, jewelry, and electronic devices inside. Unsure of how to respond, Ben asked,'What are you trying to say?'' Morimoto replied, 'Understand, Ben! I think my father and uncle areinvolved in illegal activities.' Although Ben might have sensed this before, he assured Morimoto that hisfather was a good man and likely not involved in such matters. Morimoto, slightly smiling, pulled out adeck of playing cards and asked Ben to watch. While performing a few magic tricks, Morimoto distractedBen's attention, eventually taking Ben's MP3 player from his pocket. Unaware of what was happening,Ben was astonished by Morimoto's magic. Morimoto, finishing his magic show, revealed the MP3 player,and Ben, trying to feel it in his pocket, realized it was gone. Morimoto, with a whisper, asked, 'How didyou do that?' Morimoto explained that he met his uncle the day after the late-night visit and learnedsome sleight-of-hand techniques and distraction techniques. Curious about the purpose of these skills,Ben asked, 'What do you plan to do?' Morimoto responded, 'Not me, but what do we plan to do?'Concerned about the danger, Ben advised Morimoto to stay away from such things, emphasizing theimportance of focusing on their studies since they were still in high school. Morimoto replied, 'Noproblem.'On his way home, Ben received a call from his uncle Yuji Minori. His uncle asked where Ben was, and Benreplied that he was walking home from Tokyo Tower and would be home shortly. His uncle instructedhim to wait in front of the My Basket Shibuyahoncho market. Puzzled about why he needed to wait, Benasked, and his uncle replied, 'It's a surprise.' A few minutes later, his uncle arrived in a 1997 NissanLaurel, asking Ben how he liked it. Although Ben usually didn't care much for cars, he appreciated thesimplicity of this one and casually said, 'It's okay.' Ben and his uncle headed towards Daikoku ParkingArea. While on the Daikoku road, Ben repeatedly asked his uncle what the surprise was, but his uncleinsisted, 'You'll see.' Arriving at the parking area, Ben, shocked by the cars he saw, was fascinated andimpressed. Despite not having seen such cars before, his interest was piqued.After parking the car, Ben and his uncle got out together, strolling around the parking area, examiningthe flashy cars. While Ben was engrossed in studying the cars, his uncle seemed more interested inselling his car, stating the price to onlookers as if he were there for a sale. Hearing the prices of the cars,Ben realized that without saving for 5 to 10 years, he wouldn't be able to afford such amounts in hislifetime. Shaken by this harsh reality, the idea Morimoto suggested crossed Ben's mind.Ben called Morimoto and declared, 'We're going to do it, but it will be on my terms.' The idea in Ben'smind was to use Morimoto's magic tricks and mastery of distraction, learned during high school, topickpocket flash drives, MP3 players, or inexpensive yet valuable accessories from classmates. It hadbeen a week since Ben started high school. Throughout the week, he took notes on the belongings of hisclassmates, preparing for the right moment. The time had come.Due to attending different high schools, Ben and Morimoto had to execute their plan independently. BenNao Kylian studied at Kanto International High School, while Morimoto transferred to Shibuya JuniorHigh School, his previous middle school. Morimoto's younger sister Mina continued attending ShibuyaJunior High School. Aware of the severity of their actions, Ben and Morimoto understood the potentialconsequences of being caught, surpassing mere disciplinary measures.Over two months, they collected MP3 players, accessories, and other items of little value but enough tobring them a decent amount. However, unable to sell the items, they found themselves without theexpected financial gain. The reason was their lack of knowledge on how to sell the stolen items.Morimoto and Ben spent hours listening to the various songs on the stolen MP3 players, broadeningBen's musical taste.Towards the end of June, while walking in Shinjuku Gyoen Park, Ben and Morimoto contemplated theirnext move. Morimoto, slowing his steps, looked up and told Ben, 'I have an idea, but if we get a negativeresponse, it's over for both of us.' Morimoto then revealed the plan: utilizing Mina's presence at themiddle school to sell the items to other students at lower prices. Although Ben disapproved of the idea,he couldn't think of an alternative. Reluctantly, Ben accepted Morimoto's suggestion. Morimoto took outhis phone, called Mina, and arranged to meet her under the Tokyo Tower at 6:00 PM.Meeting at Tokyo Tower, Ben and Morimoto explained their plan to Mina. Initially giving Morimoto astern look, Mina's expression softened when she turned her gaze towards Ben. She accepted theproposal. With less than a month left until Ben graduated from high school and Morimoto and Minacontinued with their education, they decided to capitalize on the money they had accumulated over thepast two years.However, despite the savings, Morimoto and Ben realized that they had spent most of the money. WhileMorimoto spent on various things, Ben had not spent a single yen, fearing potential repercussions. Bendesired a modest car like his uncle's but was short of 700,000 yen. Rumors and theft incidents circulatingin school made their operations more challenging. The students had become more cautious, and theirability to engage in such activities had diminished.Approaching graduation day, with only five days left, Ben saw a girl hiding a valuable accessory in ahidden compartment in her bag. The accessory, worth almost 600,000 yen, presented a chance for Bento afford the car he desired after graduating from high school. During the last break before the finalclass, Ben approached the girl's desk, started rummaging through her bag, but was interrupted when anunfamiliar boy entered the classroom.Ben was frozen, unable to utter a word, as the boy quickly left the class and ran to the principal's office.Ben began feeling the uncertainty of how this situation would end and his heart raced. Nervously, hechecked left and right before leaving the classroom and sprinting down the stairs. As he exited the schoolgate, a security guard stopped him, urging him to go through the proper channels and that it was anemergency. The security guard grabbed Ben's arm, asking him to look back. When Ben turned around, hesaw the principal and the boy who had seen him through the school window. Angry and anxious, Benheaded towards the principal's office, contemplating how he would get out of this situation.Upon reaching the principal's office, the principal told Ben, 'I'm calling your parents; they need to beinformed.' Anxiously awaiting, Ben's parents entered the office as the principal, looking at Ben, utteredthe words, 'I understand, but nobody, including me, will believe this.' Ben's parents sat on the singlechair in front of the principal. The principal, despite being aware of the situation, dismissed the casewithout taking any action, suggesting to Ben's parents that their son was misunderstood.After the incident, Ben's parents became more cautious about securing their personal belongings athome. While Ben was aware of the increased privacy measures, he refrained from mentioning that hewas the cause of their diminished trust. Ben's academic life did not continue after this event. Despite hisdesire to attend university, he felt he wouldn't receive support from his family for school expenses andchose not to continue. ","7":"Ben Nao Kylian's love life came to a bitter end with a bad experience. Previously just friends with MinaTetta, Ben met Mina through his closest friend Morimoto, and they had only conversed during their highschool days when they engaged in pickpocketing activities. Sitting alone on a bench in Shiba Park, stillunaware that it was his birthday night, Ben was contemplating the reaction his father had given himduring their argument.Ben's phone had rung multiple times, but he ignored it and turned it off. When it rang one last time, hetook it out, and on the screen, he saw Mina's call. Answering the phone, he asked what was wrong. Minaquestioned, 'We were supposed to meet at midnight, did you forget?' Ben explained that due to thesituation with his father, it completely slipped his mind, narrating the events. Although Mina askedwhere he was, Ben remained silent, listening to the phone without making a sound. Despite the lack ofresponse, Mina said, 'I'm coming,' and hung up.A few minutes later, Mina arrived at the front of the bench where Ben was sitting and joined him. Afterasking several times if Ben was okay without receiving an answer, she tightly hugged him. Pulling back,she looked into Ben's eyes and said, 'I'll always be here for you.' Promising that Morimoto and herselfwould never leave Ben alone, Mina assured him that he had a place to stay. Even though Ben said he hadnowhere to stay, Mina insisted he should not worry about it. Ben found comfort in Mina's offers andappreciated her help, and he started developing feelings for her.When midnight arrived, Mina celebrated Ben's birthday and reiterated that she would always be by hisside. She took out the money Ben had collected during high school from her bag and handed it to him,explaining that she had given half to Morimoto to make it fair. Ben, shocked by Mina's gesture, couldn'taccept that even 800,000 yen was too much for him. In response, Mina, looking at Ben withdetermination, said, 'I won't accept objections; this is my gift. Just be careful when using the money, andtake me on a trip when you get your car.' Despite not fully understanding what to be cautious about,Ben thanked Mina and placed a kiss on her cheek. After kissing Mina, Ben anxiously awaited herreaction, unsure of how he found the courage to do it. Blushing with embarrassment after the innocentkiss, Mina took Ben's hand, lifting him up, and they walked hand in hand for the entire way.The special moment with Mina lingered in Ben's mind for weeks. As time passed, the closeness betweenBen and Mina increased, and they began to reveal more of their shared qualities. Mina, who waspassionate about fine arts, aspired to become a free-spirited painter. However, her family's financialsituation made it challenging to pursue this dream. Displaying every drawing she created with hercolorful world and creative energy, Mina sought approval and praise from Ben. Seeing Mina's drawingsinspired Ben for his own future through her, making his difficult times seem lighter and more enjoyable.Mina's energy boosted Ben's passion for life.Despite Ben's reluctance to accept financial help from his mother, he started working at the samestationery store as Mina to spend more time with her. While Ben was close to Morimoto like a brother,his growing closeness with Mina made him tense and awkward around Morimoto, whom he couldn'texplain the situation to. After receiving a gift from Mina, Ben called his uncle Yuji to express his desire tobuy the car. As the new owner of the car, Ben wanted to fulfill Mina's request for a trip. While drivingMina from the stationery store, they faced an accident due to the brakes not working, resulting in Bentragically losing Mina Tetta, the girl he loved but never confessed his feelings to.After waking up in the hospital and learning of Mina's death from his waiting mother, Ben's heart wasshattered. Lying on a stretcher, tears streaming down his closed eyes, Ben had learned of Mina's absencein such a sudden and painful way. After being discharged from the hospital, Ben was devastated. Eachtime he closed his eyes, the words of love he wanted to say to Mina echoed in his mind. This painfulexperience taught Ben the importance of expressing emotions, showing love openly, and not missingmoments in life. Struggling to cope with Mina's loss, Ben felt as if a part of him was missing withoutMina's vibrant energy and joy. Following this tragic event, Ben began smoking and promised himself thathe would never allow anyone he loved as much as Mina into his car, even if it meant taking a taxi. ","8":"After graduating from high school, Ben Nao Kylian started working at his grandfather's Yoshi Cha teahouse in Sagamihara, upon his mother's request. Yoshi Cha was known for its adherence to traditionalJapanese customs. Although Ben didn't want to work due to disagreements with his grandfather, hechose not to upset his mother. As a waiter at the tea house, Ben faced verbal taunts and sarcasticremarks throughout his time there, particularly because of his mother's remarriage.Despite expressing to his mother that he didn't need this job, she preferred to remain silent about hisgrandfather's words. Initially, Ben started by simply serving tea to the customers who visited the teahouse. However, over time, his mother began educating Ben on the intricacies of making tea. Teachinghim the teachings of Japanese tea culture, she helped Ben not only in the preparation of tea but also inunderstanding a significant part of Japanese culture. During his work, Ben engaged in conversations withregular customers at Yoshi Cha, each carrying unique backgrounds and stories. Through these stories,Ben learned the details of Japanese culture and acquired information that he couldn't learn from books.After a while, Ben's grandfather expressed dissatisfaction, stating that Ben wasn't fully committed to thejob and announced a reduction in his pay. Ben, accustomed to his grandfather's displeasure, chose not toreact and decided to quit his job. After leaving the tea house, he went to his uncle Yuji's place andstarted working at Yuji Stop. Initially, Ben recorded the hours of vehicles coming in and out, a task hefound unenjoyable. At his own insistence, he stopped taking notes and started cleaning vehicles. Despiteenjoying cleaning, the exhaustion from the work left him with little time for his hobbies and meeting hisfriends Morimoto and Mina.Ben decided to leave Yuji Stop, and a few years later, after a fight with his father, he moved in with hisfriends Morimoto and Mina. To spend more time with Mina and earn his own money, Ben startedworking at the same stationery store as Mina. He handled tasks such as moving boxes, organizingproducts, and replacing old items. The stationery store also served as a gift shop, attracting universitystudents from different countries who worked there as part of a foreign student exchange program toimprove their Japanese language skills.Following Mina's death, Ben, in a psychologically challenging state, could not return to the nostalgicstationery store and decided to end that job. ","9":"Ben Nao Kylian was a person born and raised in Japan, inheriting traditional values from his Japanesemother and a sense of freedom from his American father. While his father instilled American culturewithin the family, the time spent with his mother allowed him to experience the knowledge of Japanesecultural traditions. Ben's maternal side placed great importance on traditional Japanese culture, holdingonto its traditions throughout the years.The habits of respect towards elders and politeness towards strangers, which were emphasized by hismother and were somewhat challenging for him to adopt, were eventually embraced, partly due to hisgrandfather's influence. Child rearing in Japanese culture is highly significant, focusing on instillingdiscipline, respect, and self-discipline in children. Ben, being a calm and quiet child, did not facedifficulties in this aspect of discipline due to his nature.Following the time spent with his mother, Ben could sense the American freedom mindset from hisfather. The most prominent and beloved feature that Ben incorporated into his habits from Japaneseculture and his mother was the concept of order. He ensured that every action he took maintained asense of order, as Japanese homes are generally kept clean and organized. The importance of order andhygiene within the home is considered a reflection of one's lifestyle, leaving positive impressions onforeigners.Upon his mother's recommendation to read books, Ben explored different tastes and eventually addedJapanese pop culture, such as Manga/Anime, which is globally popular, to his habits. His interest in JDM(Japanese Domestic Market) car culture was sparked when he attended Car Meets with his uncle. If heowned a car, he embraced the style, color, and additions typical of JDM culture.During the time he worked with his grandfather, Ben gained knowledge of Japanese tea culture throughhis mother. Although tea might seem like a simple beverage, in Japan, it represents a tradition that haspersisted for centuries. Tea is not just a drink; it is also considered an art and a meditation tool. Benoften saw his mother working in the tea house, reflecting his grandfather's intense dedication toJapanese traditions, wearing a Kimono. While he thought it suited his mother, Ben leaned more towardshis father's American culture in terms of clothing and fashion.In Japan, two dominant religions are Shintoism and Buddhism. Due to the majority of people in Japan notpracticing any religion, religious beliefs can often intertwine, and individuals may engage in variousreligious rituals simultaneously. This can vary based on cultural background or family tradition. Ben'sfamily had different religious backgrounds, with his mother being Buddhist and his father, having a whiteAmerican heritage, being Christian. Both religions were introduced to Ben equally, but he was notdirected towards either. This allowed Ben to have a free-thinking approach to religion, enabling him tomake his decisions through personal research. After researching various religions, Ben found Deism to besuitable for him.The cultural and traditional pressure imposed by his grandfather during the time spent together was anunbearable situation for Ben. This situation pushed him more towards his father's perspective onpersonal freedom and individuality. Although he faced racist attitudes towards Black people inconversations within his family, it gave him a different perspective on racism, as he did not experienceracism himself due to not having Asian features. Despite his parents' different racial backgrounds, Ben,caught in a cultural mix, shaped his own behavior, cultural habits, and religious orientation based onwhat he deemed fitting, blending American and Japanese influences. ","10":"Ben Nao Kylian had heard of Los Santos as the city where his grandparents lived, as told by his father during his elementary school years. Although his father had promised to visit on a suitable vacation, Ber couldn't seize the opportunity. After the fight with his father, Ben left home and continued his life witr Mina and Morimoto. Determined to keep his promise to Mina, he decided to buy a car from hisunclr Yuji Minori using the 800 million yen Mina gave him on his birthday and his savings. With the car, hr planned to take Mina on a journey to South Korea. After the South Korea trip, he intended to proposr going to Los Santos together to visit his grandparents with Minar In the aftermath of his father and mother leaving the house, Ben went to Los Santos to assist his mother and father in overcoming economic difficulties. After obtaining permission from the stationery storr where he worked, Ben exited the store and called his uncle to inquire about the car. His uncle hastilr agreed, assuming that Ben's father was visiting Los Santos, and mentioned that he could come pick ur the car immediately. Arriving at his uncle's place, Ben noticed that the car's color had changed, and itr front bumper was missing. When he inquired about the bumper, his uncle assured him it would br reattached soon and that there was nothing to worry about. Ben also asked about his father'r whereabouts, and his uncle revealed that he thought Ben's father had come to visit Los Santos. Benr used to his father not keeping promises, left without expressing his true feelingsr After reaching his uncle's place, Ben moved to the next chapter of his life, living with Mina anr Morimoto. Working at the stationery store, he handled tasks like moving boxes, organizing products, anr replacing old items. This particular store had a unique setting, serving as a gift shop and attractinr university students from different countries for language exchange, thus fostering Japanese languagr development. Following Mina's death, Ben, emotionally affected, decided to quit the storer During these events, Ben experienced both cultural clashes and a mixture of traditions due to hir parents' different backgrounds. He crafted his behavior, cultural habits, and religious orientationr embracing a blend of American and Japanese influences. His interest in Japanese tea culture, influencer by his mother, and his passion for JDM car culture were also significant aspects of his identityr The story took a tragic turn when Ben and Mina got into a car accident. Mina lost her life in the crashr leaving Ben devastated. Upon waking up in a hospital bed, Ben learned about Mina's death and hir injuries. He left the hospital, ignoring the pain, and immediately went to buy cigarettes. Struggling witr the voices in his head, he decided to confide in his grandparents in Los Santos. Before leaving his sharer home with Mina and Morimoto, he packed his belongings and left a farewell, promising not to brinr anyone he loved into his car againr Walking out of the apartment building, Ben lit a cigarette, observing passing cars until he finished it. Hir mind echoed with Mina's words, 'Always.' Taking the first taxi he saw, he headed to Tokyo Internationar Haneda Airport. During the ride, he sent a message to his mother, informing her of his departure. Laterr his father tried calling, but Ben ignored the call, putting his phone on airplane mode. After paying for thr taxi, he entered the airport, purchased a ticket to Los Santos, and waited for two hours. As the boardinr time approached, Ben, holding a pack of cigarettes and Mina's photo in his left hand, boarded the planr to Los Santos, prepared to share his story with his grandparents. ","12":"The loss of Mina still pained my heart, but I couldn't continue this way. Firstly, I need a place to stay.Before meeting my grandparents and explaining to them what my father did and the events thatunfolded, I must take steps for my future and make friends whom I can lean on. Starting from scratch likethis has never been easy for anyone, and it won't be easy for me either. I need to prepare myself for thissituation. The air in Japan is different from Los Santos, and even getting used to it will take some time forme. After spending some time in the city, even if I don't meet my grandparents, searching for theirwhereabouts seemed like a good idea. Going to government offices to at least find out if they are aliveand, if they are, where they live would be a logical step. I can postpone the introduction phase to adifferent time. Getting to know the city and not getting lost on my own will require me to take a taxi orbe guided by a kind-hearted person. Using a taxi while getting to know the city seemed impractical, as Iknew it would burn a hole in my wallet. So, I might go to a crowded, warm place where I can eat,possibly guided by a taxi driver or a kind local. If I find a place for conversation, I could join in a discussionon a topic I'm familiar with and make connections. If I'm lucky, people I meet when leaving a venue couldintroduce me to the city. The work experiences I gained while working with my mother and uncle couldhelp me. Although I'm new in the city, I needed a job that would provide income—something like waitingtables or cleaning cars would do at the beginning. To get around and explore the city on my own terms, avehicle would be handy. Filling the void left by Morimoto's friendship would be challenging. I couldimmerse myself in sports, something I didn't get the chance to do in Japan, to distract myself fromMina's lingering memories in my mind. Despite not feeling ready, I would have to be cautious with mygirlfriend relationships once I stabilize my financial situation and establish a circle of friends. The hatredinstilled in me by my uncle made me contemplate continuing my family lineage with a different heritagerather than the Japanese one. ","fear":"Ben Nao Kylian's most intense phobia is the involuntary twitching and itching he experiences when hesees an insect or a reptile, whether dead or alive. While living in Japan, this occurrence was frequent,causing him to instinctively avoid dried insect-like foods at food stalls and involuntarily scratch himselfwhile walking.Ben has a natural fear of heights, which he experienced more intensely during middle school. Theexacerbation of his fear occurred when he and his friends went to enjoy the view from the top of TokyoTower. Despite climbing to the top to prove himself to his friends, he faced his fear of heights everyweek. His efforts to overcome the fear proved futile, and his fear of heights not only persisted butworsened.Aside from his phobia, Ben Nao Kylian has a few other fears. The most significant one is the fear of losinga loved one. This fear stems from losing his girlfriend, Mina Tetta, in a car accident during a drive theytook together. After this incident, Ben vowed not to let anyone as valuable as Mina into his car and evenpromised to use a taxi if needed.Another fear of Ben's is letting down people who have expectations of him and being unable to meetthose expectations. This fear originates from his childhood, where he constantly sought approval fromhis grandfather but never received appreciation and often faced disdain. ","negative":"In various situations, Ben Nao Kylian tends to be indecisive about his reactions and occasionally stutters.This tendency is rooted in the cultural conflicts between his parents during his childhood, influencing theway Ben responds to situations.Initiating the first conversation with people poses a challenge for him. This difficulty arises from Ben'selementary school life, where he attempted to start conversations due to not having slanted eyes, butconsistently received negative reactions.Ben Nao Kylian is a profane individual. However, he takes care to avoid using offensive language inserious settings or during interactions with public officials. According to Ben, profanity doesn't diminishthe quality of conversation; instead, it adds sincerity. This mindset is influenced by his closest friend inschool, Morimoto.Having a negative mindset, Ben Nao Kylian evaluates potential drawbacks before making decisions andoffering opinions. This tendency is a result of many unfavorable outcomes in his past experiences.He is a skeptical character. Although he didn't have preconceived biases before, Ben Nao Kyliandeveloped skepticism after a tragic incident that led him to Los Santos. His uncle, Yuji Minori, indirectlydeceived Ben, leaving him in a difficult situation, leading him to approach people with skepticism.Impatience sets in when Ben knows he has to wait for an extended period. He does not worry or exhibitimpatience for uncertainties in completing tasks. In order to acquire things that might be difficult toobtain, he can resort to shortcuts and questionable methods, often finding himself in a state ofindecision. This mindset sometimes leads him into a state of intense stagnation. "},"carter":{"description":"Carter was born on October 3, 1998, at Niños Ricardo Gutiérrez Hospital in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

He abandoned his toys related to the game and became glued to the television. The high speed of the cars in Formula 1 intrigued Jay, sparking his interest in the races. Despite his desire to attend tournaments as he grew older, his father insisted it was impossible, and he could only watch them on TV. At the age of 10, Jay witnessed some old model cars racing around Humboldt Park on the west side of Chicago, outside the context of Formula 1. The sight of people racing cars and the thrill of speed in his neighborhood fascinated him. He went to a nearby auto repair shop and asked them to hire him, stating that he could do whatever they needed. The owner, Luis, initially chuckled at the idea of hiring a child but decided to give Jay a chance to handle odd jobs. This opportunity excited Jay, as his main goal was to learn the trade quickly and buy his own car. Over a period of about 5 months, Luis noticed Jay's ambition and started teaching him the job. One day, after leaving the repair shop, Jay saw the racing cars again and ran after them, gradually memorizing the route they took. By the age of 12, he believed he had mastered the job, but Luis knew there was more to learn. When a modified car arrived at the repair shop, Jay became extremely excited and started examining the car. Looking through the car window, he was amazed at the advanced features and felt overwhelmed with excitement. The owner explained that he was taking a break and would be heading to a car meeting in San Bernardino, California, to participate in a car gathering. Jay eagerly noted the location, looking forward to going there in the future. At the age of 16, despite the challenges, Jay continued to strive for his dreams. He discovered car meetings in his city and realized that he could earn money by taking photos and videos of cars. Although limited by his work at the repair shop, Jay eventually left his job to focus more on editing and photography, earning substantial income. After three years of attending car meetings, Jay accumulated enough money to buy his first car, a Nissan 240sx, for $2984. Despite the car's appearance, Jay cherished it as his first purchase with his own money. Jay, following his dreams, embarked on a journey to a car meeting in San Bernardino. During the long trip, he anticipated meeting new people, seeing various cars, and experiencing the atmosphere. Upon reaching the car meeting, Jay sat on the hood of a Nissan Silvia, capturing photos of a rapper. The rapper noticed the camera, approached Jay, and continued rapping while facing the camera. Lost in the ambiance of the moment, Jay felt strange emotions. After the car meeting, Jay approached the rapper, introduced himself, and exchanged contact information. The next day, with nothing else to do, Jay called the person whose number he had taken.

Jay met them, and Ren and Rian, two friends, expressed their desire to form a crew named SLY to undertake underground activities and make good money. Although initially feeling somewhat excluded, Jay eventually proved himself within the group. Ren proposed forming the SLY crew to achieve success in underground activities and make significant profits, a proposition that resonated with Jay's desire for easy money.

","4":"Russell Reed, born on April 1, 1999, faced racial prejudice during his school years in Los Santos, particularly at the upscale Wild Oats Drive where his idyllic childhood transformed into a challenging reality; supported by his mother Karen, Russell navigated through high school, forming a bond with Dave, and encountered a pivotal moment at a party organized by Dante, sparking a series of nightlife adventures that strained his familial bonds and academic pursuits, leading to a rift with his father Roman and a permanent departure from his family home; finding refuge at Dante's, Russell continued his party lifestyle, ultimately jeopardizing his education and facing tough love from his family; despite interventions, Russell's rebellion persisted, prompting him to leave home for good and find sanctuary with Dante; a chance encounter with a job ad at Vespucci Beach marked a turning point, leading Russell to his first job interview at Flints Autos, where skepticism turned into an opportunity, and he thrived in sales and marketing for four years; unforeseen circumstances unfolded, resulting in the closure of Flints Autos, leaving Russell devastated and seeking answers from Henry, the owner, who faced legal consequences; grappling with a sense of loss and isolation, Russell found renewed purpose with the support of friends Dave and Dante, venturing into an uncertain job market, wandering the streets of Los Santos, and confronting challenges in search of a new path forward.","5":"On March 6, 1996, at a dinner held at Eclipse Towers, Russell's parents, Karen and Roman, met. This dinner was arranged for the two companies to collaborate more effectively and make joint decisions for better business. This coincidental encounter would be a turning point in their lives. Roman, with the advertising company he founded in 1994, began to make a name for himself in Los Santos and worldwide. Karen, on the other hand, started working for a famous business in LosSantos in 1992 and became a sales consultant for this business until 1996. Karen was a beautiful woman with wheat-colored skin, green eyes, and curly hair.Her energy and cheerfulness always radiated to those around her. Roman, on the other hand, was a black, intelligent, charismatic man known for his workaholic nature. Both of them were aware of their commonalities and how well they complemented each other during this introduction dinner. They initially started meeting under the pretext of business, but upon Roman's insistence, they eventually went out for a private dinner. After getting to know each other better, they started meeting at every opportunity, making time for each other. The marriage of Karen and Roman was the result of a relationship that lasted for several years before Russell's birth. After Russell's birth, Roman's business became even busier. As a result, he couldn't spend much time with Russell. Initially, Russell used to wait for his father to come home until late at night, pretending to be asleep when his father finally arrived. His father, tired, would go straight to bed, and they could only spend one or two hours together. After a while, Russell stopped waiting until late at night, accepting the situation. Although his father tried to compensate for it with gifts, Russell was aware of the situation, but there was nothing he could do. During these times, all he wished for was his father to work less. Every night, he would look at the stars through his window and pray for this. In Russell's eyes, his mother has always been in a very high place. Karen was the one who protected and advised him. She provided guidance during the challenges he faced in school and helped shape his character. Even though Russell couldn't spend much time with Roman, Karen somehow filled that gap. Karen was the one carrying the family burden and maintaining order. ","6":"Russell started his school life with great excitement. In the early periods of his school life, he faced difficulties for a long time due to situations like racism and exclusion. The school's high status meant that his teachers always paid extra attention to him. Russell began his school life with good grades. However, when he reached middle/high school, there was a decline in his grades, and he wasn't studying enough. Factors contributing to this included the expansion of his circle of friends and his constant distraction. He started attending parties, constantly hanging out, and neglecting his studies due to the time he dedicated to his friends. It was as if he found himself in these party environments. His family was uncomfortable with this situation, and Roman, in particular, could no longer be patient with him. Russell was constantly punished, yelled at, and Roman's frustration was growing. As these events continued, the number of arguments increased. Roman was distorting Russell's words and pressuring him constantly. Russell didn't care much about what his father said. In his mind, his father punished him because he didn't spend time with him and didn't fulfill his role as a father. Unable to bear Russell's indifference, Roman finally snapped, saying, 'If you don't improve your grades, you won't go to college. Then you can makefriends from the lower neighborhood and wander around as much as you want withthem!' He then slapped Russell. Russell, in the throes of adolescence, where he thought he knew everything and his self-confidence was at its peak, couldn't bear this slap to his pride and ran to his room. Packing his belongings, he left the house that night. Dave was his best friend, but he couldn't go to their place. Since Dante lived alone, he was the most suitable person to stay with. Due to his stubbornness, Russell neglected his studies. He graduated from school with low grades. He couldn't ask for support from his family due to this stubbornness, and he wasn't considering going to school anymore. He put an end to his educational life by graduating from high school. ","7":"Russell had never been in a relationship until high school. During his high school years, he met Betty at a party, encouraged by Dante, and had his first intimate experience. It was a one-night stand, and they never spoke or met again. Russell had never experienced a regular relationship. His expectation in terms of relationships was to have a partnership that would make his life easier, happy, and peaceful. Due to the social circles he frequented, he couldn't find someone suitable for himself, and he didn't even bother trying because the people he met didn't match his logic and thoughts precisely. ","8":"Russell, walking along Vespucci Beach, noticed flyers hanging on a pole. When he started reading, he saw an advertisement looking for a sales representative for car parts. Without wasting time, he called the number on the ad. The owner of the ad asked him to come for a meeting within the day. Russell quickly walked to the roadside and hailed a taxi, instructing the driver to go to Flints Autos on Innocence Boulevard. During the ride, he nervously chatted with the taxi driver. The driver sensed Russell's tension and asked about the reason. Russell explained that he was nervous because it was his first job interview. By the time they arrived at the address, they had engaged in conversation. Taking a deep breath, Russell walked towards the workplace. A middle-aged man with a beard and slightly overweight, with brown hair down to his shoulders, was standing at the door. Russell approached the man and said, 'Hello, I'm Russell Reed. Did I speak with you on the phone?' Henry smiled and replied, 'Hello Russell, I'm Henry, nice to meet you. Yes, you called for a job application. I didn't expect you to come so quickly. Let's go inside; we can talk more comfortably.' Seeing Henry's smile, Russell's tension eased a bit, and he responded with a smile. Russell: 'Sure, however you prefer.' Henry opened the door for Russell by placing his left hand on Russell's right shoulder and gestured to enter the office. Henry, having heard that Russell had no previous work experience, was somewhat skeptical, but he wanted to give him a chance. He sensed Russell's enthusiasm and eagerness. The workplace specialized in selling car parts and accessories, with a small mechanic area for car repairs and painting next to it. After showing Russell around, Henry explained their work and approach. Henry recognized that Russell had good communication skills, making him suitable for the marketing and sales department. Since Russell didn't have the knowledge for the mechanical part, Henry couldn't assign him there. After touring the workplace, Henry turned to Russell and said, 'I want you here tomorrow at 10 am. Don't be late. I'll determine your days off and compensation based on the job you do.' Saying this, he headed towards his office. Russell thanked him for the opportunity with a smile. In the evening, he shared the news with Dante, excited that he could stand on his own feet. For four years, he worked in that place, handling many responsibilities and tasks, often covering for Henry. The money he earned was enough for Russell, and he even felt it was more than sufficient. He believed he could work there for the rest of his life. One day, three men in suits came to Flints Autos. As they entered, a police team followed them. The tallest man in the suits stated that they wanted to talk to Henry. Russell, realizing that something bad was happening, guided them to the office. Loud voices from Henry were audible inside. Suddenly, the office door opened, and the police dragged Henry outside, handcuffing him. The tall man in the suit said, 'We need your business to close.' Russell told the other employees, 'We'll be closed until Henry comes back.' and went to the office. Everyone left the workplace grumbling. Russell sadly and slowly packed his belongings. After packing, he took a last look around and sighed. Russell locked the main door and called Dante to pick him up. When Dante arrived, Russell explained the situation to him, and they went home sadly. Russell tried to contact Henry several times, but his calls went unanswered. When he went to the police department to inquire, he was told that Henry had been sentenced, and he could request a visit. Russell didn't realize how serious the situation was until then. He thought Henry would come back and reopen the business in a few days, but a month had passed, and he decided to get more information. He quickly got ready, went to the prison, and requested a visit. The prison officers told him that he could meet Henry. When Henry came into the meeting room, he said: Henry: 'Thank you for coming. I'm sure you have many questions on your mind. I can't answer these questions. You should look for a new job. It's tough for me to get out of here.' Russell, with teary eyes, said: 'You've done so much for me. You taught me the job, earned me money. I owe you a lot. Do you need anything?' Henry, smiling, replied: 'Your visit is enough for me. Take care of yourself.' After this conversation, Henry smiled, ran his hand through Russell's hair, and the meeting ended. Russell, feeling even more saddened, closed himself off for a while. With the support of Dave and Dante, he slowly pulled himself together and started looking for a new job. You may see Russell wandering around Los Santos streets and checking ads for a while.","9":"Russell Reed's culture is primarily based on the complex and diverse social fabric of Los Santos. While one side of Santos is filled with skyscrapers, the other side is adorned with graffiti and street art. One of the significant factors that ties Russell to this city is this intricate structure. During his initial exploration of himself, the cultures of other people seemed strange, but as he got to know them, he started accepting their cultures. The prominent cultures he embraced include Black, hip-hop, street, and car cultures. He always supported the Black culture; after all, Russell himself was Black. Although he sometimes found the excessive use of culture bothering, he never cut off his support. He connected with hip-hop culture through one of the first tracks he listened to, Wu-Tang Clan - C.R.E.A.M. The song depicted the life of the lower neighborhood he constantly saw and heard about, making him feel like he could see the people he met in that song. He encountered street culture during his high school years. Seeing different people with different styles in various environments, he became curious about the intricacies of this culture as he got to know them. After meeting these people, he started noticing graffiti on the streets, B-boys dancing on street corners, and MCs freestyling, and if he had the time, he would watch them from a corner. Despite being Black, Russell had a late introduction to this culture; he felt like he was born into it during his high school years, as if life had taught him everything later on. Although he initially didn't care for car culture, he began hearing about it at Flints Auto's. The people working there only talked about incoming cars and the challenges of their work. This culture caught his attention; almost every incoming car had unique features. During his work hours, he researched cars he found visually appealing. After starting to work, one of the first cars that caught his eye was the Chino Custom; usually favoring Japanese cars, Russell was genuinely in love with a lowrider-type car. The owner took great care of the car; it had chrome parts almost everywhere, and there was no dirt on any part of it. Russell had never seen such a well-maintained car before. When he had a garage of his own, Russell also wanted to tinker with his car. He constantly researched incoming cars. Suddenly, he found himself immersed in this culture. His colleagues at work started taking Russell to car meets and roll nights. Russell didn't particularly like his coworkers, but he enjoyed these plans.
